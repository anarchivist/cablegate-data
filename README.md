This Git repository has been derived from the [WikiLeaks Cablegate](http://213.251.145.96/cablegate.html) site. The majority of the data and content has been received through torrents. As of 3 Dec 2010 Wikileaks.org is down at the DNS level and we have had to switch to other sources.

The notable exceptions are this file (README.md) and the index.html file located within this directory. The former was created manually, and the latter was retrieve using {wget, curl, etc.} directly from http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/index.html .

Please feel to mirror/redistribute this repository.
