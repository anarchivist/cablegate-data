Van Diepen.  Reason 1.5 (D) &#x000A;&#x000A;-----------&#x000A;(U) Summary&#x000A;----------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (S) A U.S. interagency team -- lead by ISN Acting&#x000A;Assistant Secretary Vann H. Van Diepen -- met with a Russian&#x000A;interagency team lead by Vladimir Nazarov, Deputy Secretary&#x000A;of the Russian National Security Council (full participants&#x000A;list is provided in paragraphs 76-77 below), on December 22,&#x000A;2009 for a second round of discussions on a Joint Threat&#x000A;Assessment (JTA), as agreed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev&#x000A;in the 2009 U.S.-Russia Summit Joint Statement on Missile&#x000A;Defense Issues.  The Russian delegation came prepared to&#x000A;engage seriously, and made  presentations on their evaluation&#x000A;of the missile programs of Iran and the DPRK; a conceptual&#x000A;framework for evaluating the risk posed by various missile&#x000A;programs; Russian concerns about instability in Pakistan and&#x000A;the security of nuclear weapons and missiles there; and the&#x000A;work of the FSB (Federal Security Service) in countering&#x000A;efforts by Iranian and North Korean agencies to either obtain&#x000A;nuclear and missile technologies and materials in Russia or&#x000A;to transship the&#x000A;m through Russian territory.  While the Russians were&#x000A;prepared for discussions of cooperation at a strategic level&#x000A;on countering missile proliferation, their position remained&#x000A;the same: in their analysis, the missile programs of Iran and&#x000A;the DPRK are not sufficiently developed, and their intentions&#x000A;to use missiles against the U.S. or Russia are nonexistent,&#x000A;thus not constituting a "threat" requiring the deployment of&#x000A;missile defenses.  The discussions included a vigorous&#x000A;exchange of questions and answers, and concluded with an&#x000A;invitation by the Russians to hold the next round of the JTA&#x000A;in Moscow in March or April 2010.  The discussions lasted the&#x000A;full day.  End Summary. &#x000A;&#x000A;-------------------&#x000A;(U) Opening remarks&#x000A;------------------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (S) Van Diepen recalled that the July 2009 U.S.-Russia&#x000A;Joint Statement called for U.S. and Russian experts to work&#x000A;together to analyze ballistic missile threats and that the&#x000A;U.S. side had provided analyses of Iran's and North Korea's&#x000A;missile programs at the September JTA.  He said that the U.S.&#x000A;side looked forward to receiving Russian perspectives on&#x000A;these programs and discussing areas of agreement and&#x000A;disagreement.  He added that the U.S. hoped that development&#x000A;of a more shared perspective on these issues would help&#x000A;inform how the U.S. and Russia address missile threats&#x000A;bilaterally and multilaterally.  Consistent with the Joint&#x000A;Statement and the non-paper U/S Tauscher provided to Russia&#x000A;in November, this effort also could help the U.S. and Russia&#x000A;assess how to defend against missile threats if that becomes&#x000A;necessary.  Van Diepen ended by underscoring that the U.S.&#x000A;looked forward to detailed discussions and then deciding on&#x000A;potential next steps. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (C) Nazarov thanked Van Diepen for reminding both sides of&#x000A;the context for the work of the JTA.  He noted that the July&#x000A;6 Joint Statement said that experts of both countries would&#x000A;analyze threats of the 21st century and make recommendations&#x000A;for political and diplomatic means to address them.  Russia&#x000A;takes this seriously, and President Medvedev has given the&#x000A;highest priority to this work and has instructed that this&#x000A;work be coordinated under the Security Council of the Russian&#x000A;Federation.  Accordingly, Nazarov said, the Russian&#x000A;delegation includes representatives from all of the Russian&#x000A;agencies responsible for tracking missile threats and&#x000A;countering them.   He added that the Russian side planned to&#x000A;make presentations, focusing primarily on Iran and North&#x000A;Korea.  After that, the Russian delegation would be prepared&#x000A;to comment on the presentations made by the U.S. at the last&#x000A;JTA meeting in July.   He said the Russian delegation had&#x000A;studied these materials closely and had several comments and&#x000A;questions. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (S) Nazarov concluded by noting that Russia looked forward&#x000A;to a creative dialogue and robust exchange of opinions&#x000A;between the experts of both sides.  He said Russia would&#x000A;focus primarily  on the threats from Iran and North Korea,&#x000A;noting that Russia believed the long-term strategic interests&#x000A;of the U.S. and Russia largely coincide and that the&#x000A;acquisition of nuclear and/or missile capabilities by Iran,&#x000A;North Korea, or other threshold states is unacceptable.&#x000A;Nazarov hoped that the discussions would be productive and&#x000A;potentially lead to the drafting of a joint assessment, and&#x000A;perhaps to the creation of a joint document. &#x000A;&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- ----&#x000A;(U) Russian Presentations on Iran and North Korea&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- ---- &#x000A;&#x000A;Iran: &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5. (S) Evgeny Zudin of the Russian Ministry of Defense gave&#x000A;detailed presentations on the Russian assessment of the&#x000A;Iranian and North Korean missile programs, and the degree to&#x000A;which Russia believes these programs constitute threats&#x000A;requiring missile defense responses.  For Russia, the bottom&#x000A;line is that, in essence, neither program constitutes a&#x000A;threat at the moment or in the near future. &#x000A;&#x000A;NOTE:  Russia did not provide paper copies of either&#x000A;presentation to the U.S. delegation.  END NOTE. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6. (S) On Iran, Zudin made the following points concerning&#x000A;Scud missiles: &#x000A;&#x000A;--Given the challenging and complex situation of the regional&#x000A;context that surrounds Iran, Iran's leaders view acquiring a&#x000A;missile capability as a deterrent to existent threats.  To&#x000A;that end, they also consistently exaggerate Iran's&#x000A;achievements in missile production. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The core of the Iranian missile program has been the&#x000A;evolutionary development of liquid-fueled missiles based on&#x000A;Soviet Scud technology from the 1960s. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Tehran acquired Scud B systems from a number of countries&#x000A;during the 1980s. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The Iranian version, called the Shahab-1, has a range of&#x000A;300 km and a reentry vehicle of 1 ton. &#x000A;&#x000A;--With scientific and technological assistance from North&#x000A;Korea, Iran acquired production capabilities for both the&#x000A;Scud B and the Scud C. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The Scud C, called the Shahab-2 by the Iranians, has a&#x000A;range of 550 km with a 700 kg payload. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Iran has also developed and commissioned a medium range&#x000A;ballistic missile (MRBM) called the Shahab-3, based on the&#x000A;North Korean No Dong-1 and using Scud-based technologies.&#x000A;The Shahab-3 has a range of 1,500 km and a 700 kg payload. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Iran has done a good deal of work to improve the precision&#x000A;and range of this system, creating the Shahab-3M, which Iran&#x000A;claims has a range of 2,000 km, although so far the confirmed&#x000A;range is only 1,600-1,700 km. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Russia's analysis indicates that this was achieved by&#x000A;reducing the re-entry vehicle weight to 250 kg and improving&#x000A;the engine. &#x000A;&#x000A;-- Russia also believes that this very nearly exhausts the&#x000A;potential for Iran to increase the range of the Shahab-3 or&#x000A;make further improvements to Scud-based missile technology. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7. (S) Moving on from Scud-based technology, Zudin made the&#x000A;following points on Iran's development of a 2,000 km-range&#x000A;solid propellant system: &#x000A;&#x000A;--Iran has been developing solid propellant MRBMs/IRBMs with&#x000A;better operational capability since 2000. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Currently, Russia is seeing the development of a two-stage&#x000A;intermediate (2,000 km) solid propellant missile. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The first test of this system in November 2007 failed.&#x000A;During the second test on November 12, 2008, Iran&#x000A;successfully accomplished the uplift stage of the missile. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Following the third test of the missile in May 2009, Iran&#x000A;announced that the launch was successful and that it would&#x000A;begin serial production of this missile. &#x000A;&#x000A;--This system was tested again on December 16, 2009, and Iran&#x000A;also claimed this test was successful. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The Russian assessment is that regardless of optimistic&#x000A;statements from Iran, the test of this missile was actually&#x000A;just a test of a successful prototype and that what the test&#x000A;did was allow Iran to practice first stage operation and&#x000A;stage separation. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Russia believes Iran will need another 2-3 years of testing&#x000A;to perfect the missile.  Russia believes it will not actually&#x000A;be deployed for 5-6 years. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8. (S) Zudin said that another potential success indicator&#x000A;for Iran's missile program is the Safir space launch vehicle&#x000A;(SLV) program.  He said the Safir launch on February 2, 2009&#x000A;was successful in putting the Omid  (26 kg) satellite into&#x000A;orbit.  However, Iran's first attempt to launch the satellite&#x000A;into orbit on August 17, 2008 was unsuccessful.  Russia&#x000A;assesses that in order to achieve the successful launch, Iran&#x000A;had used&#x000A;the maximum potential of its liquid-propellant technology&#x000A;(the first stage of the Safir was a Shahab-3).  As for Iran&#x000A;developing combat/offensive long-range missiles based on SLV&#x000A;technology, Russia believes, in theory, this is possible.&#x000A;However, from a military technological perspective, Russia&#x000A;believes this is unviable due to low throw weight of the&#x000A;system.  In addition, Russia believes that development of a&#x000A;long-range missile based on its SLV efforts would require&#x000A;Iran to intensify its research and development, conduct a&#x000A;series of test launches outside its territory, and increase&#x000A;throw weight and accuracy.  Thus, in Russia's view, despite&#x000A;Iran's successful launch of a satellite, it is premature to&#x000A;talk about Iran successfully developing the technology for a&#x000A;militarily useful long-range ballistic missile capacity. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9. (S) Zudin summed up his presentation on Iran by noting&#x000A;that over the last four years, Iran has successfully launched&#x000A;a 26 kg satellite into orbit and conducted several successful&#x000A;launches of a solid propellant MRBM, according to unconfirmed&#x000A;information.  However, Russia believes Iran's "success" boils&#x000A;down to creating Shahab-3-class liquid propellant missiles&#x000A;with an accuracy of several kilometers that can reach targets&#x000A;in the Middle East and Southeastern Europe, but given&#x000A;conventional warheads, these missiles cannot do substantial&#x000A;damage.  Under favorable conditions, Russia believes Iran&#x000A;might be able to begin a program to develop ballistic&#x000A;missiles with ranges of between 3,000-5,000 km after 2015,&#x000A;but Russia does not see Iran taking any steps in this&#x000A;direction.  Rather, Russia has concluded that Iran's&#x000A;ballistic missile program continues to be directed toward&#x000A;developing combat ready missiles to address regional concerns. &#x000A;&#x000A;North Korea: &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10. (S) Zudin made the following points with regard to the&#x000A;DPRK's missile program: &#x000A;&#x000A;--Over the last two decades North Korea has paid increased&#x000A;attention to developing and producing ballistic missiles and&#x000A;SLVs. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The DPRK has commissioned the production of liquid&#x000A;propellant missiles such as Scud Bs and Cs (which North Korea&#x000A;calls the Hwasong 5 and 6), the No Dong I, the short-range&#x000A;KN-02, and the "Luna-M" tactical missile, plus solid&#x000A;propellant battlefield and tactical rockets. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The core of North Korea's missile capability is missile&#x000A;technology from the 1960s. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The potentially outdated No Dong-1, with a range of&#x000A;1,000-1,300 km and a reentry vehicle of one ton, is the most&#x000A;advanced missile commissioned by the North Korean military. &#x000A;&#x000A;--In Russia's assessment, only the KN-02, with a range of&#x000A;less than 100 km, is relatively modern. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Since early in the 1990s, North Korea has slowly developed&#x000A;missiles of the Taepo Dong class. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Russia estimates that the Taepo Dong-1 (TD-1) was a&#x000A;prototype two-stage liquid propellant missile with a&#x000A;2,000-2,500 km range. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The TD-I first stage used a No Dong-1 engine, and the&#x000A;second stage used a Scud engine. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The only flight test of the TD-I was conducted on August&#x000A;31, 1998, during which the DPRK practiced separation of&#x000A;missile stages.  North Korea declared this test to be an SLV&#x000A;launch. &#x000A;&#x000A;--The Taepo Dong-2 (TD-2) MRBM is a two-stage liquid&#x000A;propellant missile with a range of 3,500-6,000 km, depending&#x000A;on the weight of the warhead. &#x000A;&#x000A;--A July 5, 2006 test launch of the TD-II failed as the&#x000A;missile exploded 40 seconds into flight. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Russia estimates that North Korea tested elements of the&#x000A;Taepo Dong-2 with its April 5, 2009 SLV launch. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Russia believes North Korea has demonstrated a certain&#x000A;level of progress in the missile area by creating a first&#x000A;stage engine with a thrust of 100 tons. &#x000A;&#x000A;--North Korea conducted tests of nuclear devices on October&#x000A;9, 2006 and May 26, 2009.  However, it remains unproven&#x000A;whether North Korea can make a nuclear warhead of the size&#x000A;and weight that would allow it to be carried by a ballistic&#x000A;missile. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11. (S) Zudin said that in Russia's view, the widespread&#x000A;claims about North Korea's achievements in the missile area&#x000A;are dubious.  In particular, Russia notes that it is claimed&#x000A;that North Korea has a new missile based on the Soviet R-27&#x000A;(NOTE: SS-N-6.  END NOTE) submarine-launched ballistic&#x000A;missile (SLBM) that is capable of reaching ranges of&#x000A;2,400-4,000 km.  However, the many published reports&#x000A;regarding this missile, which is known as the BM-25, contain&#x000A;claims that are made without reference to any reliable&#x000A;sources.  Moreover, Zudin said, the fact is that there have&#x000A;been no successful tests of this missile in either North&#x000A;Korea or Iran.  Russia also is unaware that this missile has&#x000A;ever been seen.  There are claims that 19 of these missiles&#x000A;were shipped to Iran in 2005, but there is no evidence for&#x000A;this and concealment of such a transfer would be impossible. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12. (S) Zudin said Russia believes the real missile potential&#x000A;of North Korea is an impressive arsenal of outdated missiles&#x000A;with ranges no greater than 1,300 km and that are only a&#x000A;threat to countries in the region that North Korea considers&#x000A;to be enemies.  Russia estimates that in the years to come&#x000A;North Korea will devote considerable effort to improving and&#x000A;perfecting its SLV.  To this end, it will use the launch&#x000A;facility near the community of Tongchang-Dong (NOTE: Known to&#x000A;the U.S. as the Yunsong facility.  END NOTE).  Russia&#x000A;assesses that North Korean development of long-range&#x000A;ballistic missiles based on SLVs is possible in principle,&#x000A;but perfection will take years.  The prospects for North&#x000A;Korea developing a combat operational system from such a&#x000A;process is not likely due to the inability to conduct&#x000A;concealed preparations for launch and the long preparation&#x000A;times. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13. (S) Summing up, Zudin said Iran's and North Korea's&#x000A;missile programs can be characterized as follows:  the only&#x000A;real successes are liquid propellant intermediate range&#x000A;missiles with ranges of 1,300 km, and both countries would&#x000A;face real technical difficulties in trying to make additional&#x000A;advances to increase the range of their systems. &#x000A;&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- ------&#x000A;(U) Discussion on Iranian and North Korean Missiles&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- ------ &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14. (S) Van Diepen thanked the Russian delegation for its&#x000A;presentations, noting that there appeared to be some areas&#x000A;where both sides agree, other areas where the two sides see&#x000A;the same thing a little differently, and areas where the two&#x000A;sides disagree.  He said it is good to have the opportunity&#x000A;to examine the differences and the reasons for them, and&#x000A;urged that this be done in a structured way.  Van Diepen&#x000A;proposed discussion begin with Iran and North Korea&#x000A;generally, and then move to specific categories of&#x000A;short-range, medium range, and long-range missiles.  On Iran,&#x000A;he said it appeared that both sides had similar assessments&#x000A;at the technical level with regard to short range missiles in&#x000A;Iran. On medium range missiles in Iran, both sides agree&#x000A;there is the original No Dong, a modified No Dong with longer&#x000A;range - although the U.S. and Russia have different ideas of&#x000A;the modifications made to achieve that longer range.  And&#x000A;both sides seem to agree that Iran is developing a two-stage&#x000A;solid propellant missile.&#x000A; Beyond that, U.S. and Russian assessments seem to diverge. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15. (S) Based on the Russian presentations, the U.S.&#x000A;delegation posed a number of questions.  The Russian&#x000A;delegation also raised a number of questions about U.S.&#x000A;comments and the U.S. presentations on Iran and North Korea&#x000A;from the September JTA talks.  The topics raised and&#x000A;follow-up discussions were as follows: &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16. (S) Shahab-3 Reentry Vehicle Mass &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. noted that based on modeling, it assesses that the&#x000A;modified Shahab-3 has 600 kg re-entry vehicle mass at a range&#x000A;of 2,000 km, and asked for Russia to explain the basis for&#x000A;its assessment of 250 kg re-entry vehicle mass. The U.S. also&#x000A;asked how useful such a missile would be as a military&#x000A;weapon.  Russia responded that there is some uncertainty in&#x000A;its estimate, conceding that the 250 kg is at the low end of&#x000A;Russia's estimate.  However, Russia believes that the low&#x000A;weight of the Shahab-3 warhead makes it pointless as a&#x000A;military weapon.  Although the range could be further&#x000A;increased with a lighter warhead, Russia's view is that such&#x000A;a missile also is pointless.  Additionally, while Russia&#x000A;views the U.S. 600 kg estimate as being close to the 700 kg&#x000A;weight of the basic Shahab-3 warhead, it assesses that the&#x000A;range of the system with that warhead is 1,300 km, not 2,000&#x000A;km.  Russia does not believe that if the weight of the&#x000A;warhead is decreased by just 50 kg, it is realistic to assess&#x000A;that the Shahab 3 would&#x000A; achieve a 2,000 km range. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17. (S) Aluminum Airframe &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. said that its assessment of a 2,000 km range for the&#x000A;Shahab-3 is achieved through the use of an aluminum airframe&#x000A;instead of steel and increased engine thrust.  Russia asked&#x000A;whether the assessment that the Shahab 3 airframe is made&#x000A;with aluminum rather than steel is based on speculation or&#x000A;fact.  The U.S. responded that the assessment derives from&#x000A;information relating to Iran seeking various aluminum alloys.&#x000A; Additionally, during the Information Exchange (IE) portion&#x000A;of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Plenary, a&#x000A;number of presentations, including by the UK and France, also&#x000A;assessed that the Shahab-3 has an aluminum airframe and&#x000A;described a number of Iranian attempts to procure aluminum&#x000A;for this purpose.  For this reason there also have been MTCR&#x000A;proposals to add the types of aluminum sought by Iran to the&#x000A;MTCR Annex. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18. (S) Safir Airframes &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. noted that it appears that the first stage of the&#x000A;Safir SLV is the Shahab-3, and asked whether Russia believes&#x000A;the Safir could achieve orbit with a steel airframe.  Russia&#x000A;answered that the facts are that the Safir was used to put a&#x000A;satellite with a very low mass into orbit.  It is likely that&#x000A;the technologies used to achieve this were exploited to their&#x000A;utmost.  Russian analysis showed that the size of the Omid is&#x000A;the limit of what Iran could put into orbit.  The U.S. agreed&#x000A; that a very low weight satellite was all that the Safir&#x000A;could put into orbit, but assessed that even orbiting such a&#x000A;small satellite could only be done using an aluminum&#x000A;airframe.  In U.S. modeling of the launch using a steel&#x000A;airframe, the Safir was not able to get close to putting&#x000A;anything into orbit. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19. (S) Russia remarked that even if the U.S. and Russia&#x000A;disagree over the materials used in the airframe, both sides&#x000A;can agree that the capability of this missile was used to its&#x000A;maximum to get a satellite into orbit.  If there is agreement&#x000A;on this point, then both sides should be able to agree that&#x000A;using this system as a weapon is pointless.  The U.S.&#x000A;responded that this was not necessarily so and would depend&#x000A;on how the rocket   is used.  The Safir launch might have&#x000A;been a technology demonstrator.  If one clustered or stacked&#x000A;the Shahab, it could be used as a longer-range system.  The&#x000A;U.S. added that something using a single Shahab as its first&#x000A;stage will have limitations, but that is not the only option. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20. (S) Using Clustered Engines &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia noted that during the JTA talks in Moscow, the U.S.&#x000A;discussed several options Iran would have with regard to a&#x000A;cluster scheme.  However, in Russia's view, the problem with&#x000A;a cluster scheme is that it makes the missile nonviable for&#x000A;military purposes.  The U.S. responded that a cluster scheme&#x000A;would make the system less mobile, but noted that it would&#x000A;provide a possibility for putting a missile further&#x000A;downrange.  However, the basic U.S. point is that the Safir&#x000A;could have been a technology demonstrator for staging,&#x000A;separation, ignition, and control of an upper stage.  Russia&#x000A;noted that it views the Safir launch as a success and has&#x000A;stated this.  Additionally, Russia agrees there are ways to&#x000A;increase the throw weight, including the clustering of&#x000A;engines, but the goal of the Russian review of Iran's missile&#x000A;capabilities was to examine whether the Iranian program could&#x000A;create a combat ready missile that meets certain&#x000A;specifications.  In Russia's view it cannot, and talking&#x000A;about the Shahab-3 as a long-range&#x000A; combat missile is unrealistic. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21. (S) The U.S. agreed it is not realistic for a mobile&#x000A;missile, but thought it would be realistic for use in a silo&#x000A;or underground.  Russia responded that such a missile would&#x000A;require a fixed launch pad.  Fifty years ago fixed launch&#x000A;pads deep inside a country were survivable, but now that is&#x000A;not realistic.  The U.S. countered that both Russia and the&#x000A;U.S. still have hundreds of such launch sites.  Russia said&#x000A;that was a topic for another discussion, not JTA. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22. (S) Iran Not Capable of Producing Longer-Range Missiles &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia said its bottom line is that Iran lacks appropriate&#x000A;structural materials for long-range systems, such as high&#x000A;quality aluminum.  Iran can build prototypes, but in order to&#x000A;be a threat to the U.S. or Russia Iran needs to produce&#x000A;missiles in mass quantities, and it lacks materials&#x000A;sufficient for the type of mass production needed to be a&#x000A;security threat.  Russia further noted that the technology&#x000A;for longer-range missiles is sophisticated and difficult to&#x000A;master.  For example, the elongated airframes Iran is using&#x000A;might not survive the stresses of a ballistic flight path,&#x000A;and the guidance system for the missile (Shahab-3) is&#x000A;outdated and does not allow for precision steering.&#x000A;According to Russian calculations, if the control system is&#x000A;used at a range of 2,000 km, it could veer as much as 6-7 km&#x000A;off its target; at 5,000 km, the accuracy could be off by&#x000A;50-60 km.  In addition, the liquid propellants used by the&#x000A;Iranians are of low efficiency.  Iran is working to improve&#x000A;the power of the engine and develop&#x000A;more efficient kinds of fuel.  However, it faces significant&#x000A;challenges.  Iran also has problems with launch preparation&#x000A;times, although it has made some recent improvements. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23. (S) Launching from Silos &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia said it does not think a Shahab-3 derived system could&#x000A;be launched from a silo.  Ground launch sites that are for&#x000A;SLVs are not suitable for military launches, and missiles&#x000A;with side-based vent engines and clustered engines cannot be&#x000A;silo-based.  The U.S. responded that this might be an area&#x000A;where U.S. and Russian assessments differ.  For example, the&#x000A;U.S. thinks the Taepo Dong-2 is a clustered missile that can&#x000A;be launched from a silo or underground launcher, adding that&#x000A;there are scenarios to compensate for shortcomings of this&#x000A;technology should the Iranians or North Koreans choose to&#x000A;pursue them. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24. (S) Iranian Solid Propellant MRBM &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. said it does not see the solid-propellant MRBM as a&#x000A;technology demonstrator.  This system has been tested four&#x000A;times in the past two years, and the U.S. assesses Iran will&#x000A;be ready to field it in less than the 5-6 year timeframe&#x000A;Russia envisions.  Russia asked how soon the U.S. thought the&#x000A;system could be ready.  The U.S. said that it would not be&#x000A;surprised if a two-stage system with a range up to 2,000 km&#x000A;were fielded&#x000A;within a year, at least in limited numbers.  The U.S. also&#x000A;noted that not all countries follow the same testing&#x000A;procedures as the U.S. and Russia.  North Korea is an extreme&#x000A;example, but Iran does not have the same test philosophy as&#x000A;either the U.S. or Russia. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25. (S) The Path to Long Range Missile Development in Iran &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. said the main potential avenue for Iran developing&#x000A;long range missiles is by using current systems as building&#x000A;blocks.  For example, using the Shahab-3 with clustered or&#x000A;stacked engines could be one path.  Another path might be the&#x000A;so-called BM-25 missile that the U.S. believes was sold to&#x000A;Iran by North Korea.  A third path might be development of a&#x000A;solid-propellant MRBM with more powerful motors.  Russia said&#x000A;that its views on the Shahab 3 had already been discussed.&#x000A;Russia had some questions about the other two paths the U.S.&#x000A;had identified.  In addition, Russia thinks it also will be&#x000A;very important to consider the intentions of Iran and North&#x000A;Korea that could lead to creation or improvement of its&#x000A;missiles.  This will affect what each side (U.S. and Russia)&#x000A;does to monitor what these countries (Iran and North Korea)&#x000A;do to acquire missile technologies, including procurement&#x000A;methods.  It also will help define the key technologies&#x000A;required by these countries now and in the future and in&#x000A;finding a means for protecting these technologies. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26. (S) The BM-25 &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia said that during its presentations in Moscow and its&#x000A;comments thus far during the current talks, the U.S. has&#x000A;discussed the BM-25 as an existing system.  Russia questioned&#x000A;the basis for this assumption and asked for any facts the&#x000A;U.S. had to provide its existence such as launches, photos,&#x000A;etc.  For Russia, the BM-25 is a mysterious missile.  North&#x000A;Korea has not conducted any tests of this missile, but the&#x000A;U.S. has said that North Korea transferred 19 of these&#x000A;missiles to Iran.  It is hard for Russia to follow the logic&#x000A;trail on this.  Since Russia has not seen any evidence of&#x000A;this missile being developed or tested, it is hard for Russia&#x000A;to imagine that Iran would buy an untested system.  Russia&#x000A;does not understand how a deal would be made for an untested&#x000A;missile.  References to the missile's existence are more in&#x000A;the domain of political literature than technical fact.  In&#x000A;short, for Russia, there is a question about the existence of&#x000A;this system. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27. (S) The U.S. repeated its earlier comment that Iran and&#x000A;North Korea have different standards of missile development&#x000A;than many other countries, including the U.S. and Russia.&#x000A;North Korea exported No Dong missiles after only one flight&#x000A;test, so it is not unimaginable that it would build and seek&#x000A;to export a system that has not been tested.  This is&#x000A;especially true for North Korea because of its need for hard&#x000A;currency.  In the U.S. view, the more interesting question is&#x000A;why would Iran buy a missile that has not been tested.  One&#x000A;possible answer is that Iran has recognized that the BM-25's&#x000A;propulsion technology exceeds the capabilities of that used&#x000A;in the Shahab-3, and that acquiring such technology was very&#x000A;attractive.  Iran wanted engines capable of using&#x000A;more-energetic fuels, and buying a batch of BM-25 missiles&#x000A;gives Iran a set it can work on for reverse engineering.&#x000A;This estimate would be consistent with the second stage of&#x000A;the Safir SLV using steering engines from the BM-25 missile. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28. (S) Safir and BM-25 &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. explained that based on a comparison of Internet&#x000A;photos of the second stage of the Safir, the U.S. assessment&#x000A;is that the steering (vernier) engines on the Safir are the&#x000A;same as on the R-27.  The weld lines and tank volumes from&#x000A;the Safir second stage show that the ratio of oxidizer to&#x000A;propellant is not consistent with Scud propellants and more&#x000A;consistent with unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and&#x000A;nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), which were used in the R-27.  The&#x000A;U.S. does not have any information on why Iran has not flight&#x000A;tested the BM-25.  It may be due to difficulties assembling&#x000A;the missiles, but it appears that they have at least done&#x000A;work with the steering (vernier) engines.  Russia asked if&#x000A;the U.S. was saying that its case for the existence of the&#x000A;BM-25 missile is that individual elements of the Safir&#x000A;resemble the steering engines of the R-27 missile. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29. (S) The U.S. said that is only part of the case.  In the&#x000A;media, and more importantly in the MTCR Information Exchange,&#x000A;countries have offered direct evidence of the transfer of the&#x000A;BM-25 from North Korea to Iran.  Russia asked if the U.S. had&#x000A;pictures of the missile in Iran.  The U.S. did not, but noted&#x000A;that North Korea had paraded the missile through the streets&#x000A;of Pyongyang.  Russia disagreed.  Russia said it had reviewed&#x000A;the video of the North Korean military parade and concluded&#x000A;that North Korea had shown a different missile.  Russia does&#x000A;not think the BM-25 exists.  The missile appears to be a&#x000A;myth, and some say that it is based on a Russian missile.&#x000A;However, no one has seen it, and Russia cannot find traces of&#x000A;it.  The U.S. said it would endeavor to provide further&#x000A;information on the existence of the BM-25 at the next round&#x000A;of talks, noting that reaching agreement on this point will&#x000A;affect the joint assessment of Iranian and North Korean&#x000A;missile capabilities. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30. (S) Safir Fuel &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia asked whether the U.S. had any clear images of the&#x000A;Safir that allow for the assessment of tank volumes and the&#x000A;ratio of fuel to oxidizer.  The U.S. said that the weld lines&#x000A;of the second stage are clear in the pictures Iran put on the&#x000A;Internet, and U.S. analysts were able to make pretty good&#x000A;calculations based on this information.  Russia questioned&#x000A;this, saying that the photos did not allow for accurate&#x000A;measurements of distances.  The U.S. undertook to provide&#x000A;more information on this point at the next round of talks. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31. (S) The U.S. then asked Russia for its assessment of the&#x000A;types of propellant used in the Safir second stage.  Russia&#x000A;said it thinks that hydrazine is used.  The U.S. asked&#x000A;whether Russia thought UDMH might be involved.  Russia did&#x000A;not.  It said that there might be different combinations of&#x000A;fuel and oxidizers, but the base is hydrazine. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32. (S) More on Propellants &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. asked whether Russia assesses that Iran is moving&#x000A;beyond Scud propellants.  Russia responded that it believes&#x000A;Iran is trying to move in this direction because it wants&#x000A;something more powerful - something that can lift 40-50 tons.&#x000A; With bigger engines, Iran can improve missile range.  Thus,&#x000A;Iran has been working to acquire more-energetic fuels and&#x000A;trying to produce UDMH and N2O4.  However, Iran has been&#x000A;working on this for approximately 10 years, and Russia has&#x000A;not seen any serious results.  Russia further noted that&#x000A;Malik Ashtar University in Tehran has been working on fuel&#x000A;combinations, but it apparently has not been successful.  The&#x000A;fact that Iran has not succeeded in this area is evident in&#x000A;Iran's effort to seek this technology from abroad. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33. (S) The U.S. noted that it was significant that both the&#x000A;U.S. and Russia assess that Iran is working on more-energetic&#x000A;propellants, even if the two sides differ in how far along&#x000A;they are.  Russia responded that this is due to the fact that&#x000A;Iran has not yet launched any longer range missiles.  There&#x000A;have been no tests, and statements from Iran that it has&#x000A;missiles that can fly 2,000 km have not been substantiated.&#x000A;The longest range that Russia has seen is 1,700 km, and that&#x000A;was achieved only because of a reduced throw weight.  If the&#x000A;U.S. has additional data to share, Russia would be&#x000A;interested.  The U.S. agreed to look into the matter and&#x000A;elaborate further at the next JTA talks. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34. (S) However, the U.S. also noted that modeling shows that&#x000A;achieving a greater range is possible.  Just because a&#x000A;capability has not been demonstrated operationally does not&#x000A;mean that it is not possible.  Once a program has achieved&#x000A;1,500 km, going a few hundred kilometers more is not that&#x000A;much of an obstacle.  Going from 1,700 to 2,000 km is not a&#x000A;great technological stretch.  Russia said it could not agree&#x000A;because with a longer flight, various parts of the missile&#x000A;could burn through, the missile could fall apart, or it could&#x000A;go off course.  It needs to be tested at its maximum range.&#x000A;As discussed earlier, the U.S. believes Iran can achieve the&#x000A;increased range due to a combination of increased thrust from&#x000A;more powerful engines, a slightly reduced payload, and the&#x000A;use of aluminum instead of steel. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35. (S) Russia disagreed with the U.S. assessment that Iran&#x000A;has been able to buy technology to produce solid propellant&#x000A;engines.  Russia believes Iran continues to work on the&#x000A;technology to mix and pour the propellant.  This is a very&#x000A;difficult process.  Solid fuel has to be very evenly mixed to&#x000A;work properly.  It must be put into the motor case and then&#x000A;allowed to solidify, and the resulting fuel must be&#x000A;homogeneous.  In addition, fuel loading is more complicated&#x000A;for larger engines, and Iran has not mastered this.  Russia&#x000A;also believes Iran is experimenting with fuel composition,&#x000A;how long fuels can be preserved, and how temperatures can&#x000A;affect the mixture.  Russia does not think that Iran has&#x000A;solved the problem of thermal isolation of the engine from&#x000A;the airframe, as the junction with the engine tends to burn&#x000A;through.  Russia also does not think that Iran has solved the&#x000A;problem of thrust vector control and gas steering&#x000A;technologies.  The old technologies are not reliable, and&#x000A;Iran has had a hard time getting&#x000A; components from abroad.  In addition, Iran cannot produce&#x000A;high-quality spherical aluminum powder and without this it&#x000A;cannot reliably produce solid fuel.  Russia noted that even&#x000A;Israel needs to buy ammonium perchlorate from abroad.  Iran&#x000A;has been trying to produce it indigenously, but Russia has no&#x000A;information indicating it has been successful.  In Russia's&#x000A;view, Iran appears to be having very serious problems with&#x000A;engine development. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36. (S) The Ashura &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia said that in June 2008, it had received information&#x000A;from the State Department that within the framework of the&#x000A;Ashura program, Iran is producing a 3-stage missile called&#x000A;the Ghadr-110.  At that time, the U.S. told Russia that this&#x000A;missile is very similar to the Pakistani Shaheen-II and has a&#x000A;range of 2,000 km with a throw weight of one ton.  Testing of&#x000A;the Ghadr-110 may have started in 2008, and Russia would like&#x000A;additional information on this system.  The U.S. said that&#x000A;there appeared to be some confusion:  the Ashura is a&#x000A;two-stage solid propellant missile with a 2,000 km range, and&#x000A;the Ghadr-110 is the Fateh-110, a single-stage SRBM. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37. (S) Sejjil &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia asked whether the Sejjil was part of the Ashura&#x000A;program.  The U.S. said it thinks the Sejjil is another name&#x000A;for the Ashura.  In addition, Iran also has a short range&#x000A;solid propellant system called the Fateh-110.  The experience&#x000A;gained from that program has been used in the development of&#x000A;the Ashura and helps explain how Iran acquired the capability&#x000A;to develop larger motors.  In the 1990s, Iran received&#x000A;production technology and infrastructure from China to&#x000A;develop solid propellants.  That infrastructure was used in&#x000A;the Fateh-110 and now is being used as the technological&#x000A;basis for the Ashura.  While the U.S. would agree that a&#x000A;larger solid propellant engine is challenging, Iran has over&#x000A;a decade of experience producing solid propellant motors and&#x000A;it got an important head start from China.  Independent of&#x000A;what Iran has since acquired, this head start allowed Iran to&#x000A;develop the Ashura, which has been flight tested&#x000A;successfully, and also to work toward longer-range systems.&#x000A;Russia did not fully agree,&#x000A;saying that the technology for an SRBM is quite different&#x000A;from medium and longer range systems. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par38' href='#par38'>¶</a>38. (S) Iranian Challenges &#x000A;&#x000A;Noting that Russia had mentioned several problems with Iran's&#x000A;efforts to develop larger motors, the U.S. asked for the&#x000A;basis of Russia's assessment and specifically whether it&#x000A;derived from the results of ground testing.  Russia responded&#x000A;that Iran is having problems generally because it did not&#x000A;develop the technology in Iran and is trying to work off of&#x000A;North Korean technology.  The U.S. then asked how Russia&#x000A;would explain&#x000A;the Ashura having been flight tested twice successfully.&#x000A;Russia said there is nothing special there as the technology&#x000A;is all old technology as described in detail in the&#x000A;literature of the Chinese Long March 4 engine.  The U.S.&#x000A;pointed out that the Long March is a liquid propellant&#x000A;system, and the Ashura is a solid propellant system.  If Iran&#x000A;has successful tests, it shows Iran has built MRBM rocket&#x000A;motors.  Russia countered that all it shows is that Iran is&#x000A;testing parts of the missile.  Iran may have claimed success&#x000A;but that is not the reality.  If Iran wants it to be&#x000A;reliable, the missile has to be tested many times before it&#x000A;can be deployed.  This is what Russia believes.  Russia&#x000A;understands the U.S. has a different point of view and this&#x000A;can be discussed again another time. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par39' href='#par39'>¶</a>39. (S) North Korean Scuds &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. said it seemed that both sides had a common&#x000A;evaluation of what types of short range systems North Korea&#x000A;possesses:  the Scud B, Scud C, and the new solid propellant&#x000A;MRBM.  Russia said that in 2008, the U.S. indicated that&#x000A;North Korean Scuds were launched at longer ranges.  Russia&#x000A;asked for any specific data on these missile launches and for&#x000A;U.S. thinking on why these systems are extended range Scuds&#x000A;and not Scud C missiles.  The U.S. said that it would try to&#x000A;provide more information on this issue at the next round of&#x000A;talks.  However, it is known that there have been at least&#x000A;two cases of North Korea helping other countries to develop&#x000A;Scuds with longer ranges than the Scud C.    One example is&#x000A;Libya.  When Libya gave up its MTCR-class missile programs in&#x000A;2003, it showed the U.S. a missile it called the "Scud-C."&#x000A;However, it had a longer range than the missile we refer&#x000A;generally refer to as the Scud-C.  Additionally, many&#x000A;presentations in the MTCR Information Exchange have reported&#x000A;that North Korea is helping other countries, particularly&#x000A;Syria, develop a Scud with a longer range.  These&#x000A;presentations have referred to this longer range system as&#x000A;the Scud-D. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par40' href='#par40'>¶</a>40. (S) No Dong &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. thought that both sides had similar assessments of&#x000A;the No Dong.  Referring to the U.S. presentation from the&#x000A;previous JTA talks, Russia noted that the U.S. said there&#x000A;were seven launches of the No Dong in July 2009 by North&#x000A;Korea.  Russia has no information on such tests, and wondered&#x000A;if there U.S. had been referring to 2006.  The U.S. said that&#x000A;there had been tests of the No Dong just after July 4, 2009,&#x000A;and that there had been plenty of South Korean and Japanese&#x000A;reporting at that time.  Russia agreed there were July 4&#x000A;missile launches, but of missiles with shorter ranges, not&#x000A;Scuds or No Dongs.  Given the confusion on this point, Russia&#x000A;urged that the issue be revisited during the next round of&#x000A;talks. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par41' href='#par41'>¶</a>41. (S) UDMH &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia asked whether the U.S. thinks North Korea is trying to&#x000A;develop a new engine that uses UDMH.  The U.S. said it&#x000A;believes this effort is connected with a new system North&#x000A;Korea is working on.  The U.S. thinks this new system is an&#x000A;IRBM. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par42' href='#par42'>¶</a>42. (S) IRBM &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia asked whether the U.S. has any specific data on this&#x000A;system.  The U.S. said it believes the system exists and has&#x000A;been sold to Iran as the BM-25. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par43' href='#par43'>¶</a>43. (S) Taepo Dong &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. agreed with Russia that the Taepo Dong-1 was a&#x000A;technology demonstrator that is no longer being used, and&#x000A;that the Taepo Dong-2 has had two tests that have been&#x000A;unsuccessful.  However, there is not agreement on the purpose&#x000A;of the Taepo Dong-2 system.  In tests, the intent has been&#x000A;billed as putting a satellite into orbit, but the U.S. also&#x000A;thinks it is very much intended as part of the development of&#x000A;an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).  Russia noted&#x000A;for clarification that North Korea calls the Taepo Dong-2 the&#x000A;Unha-2. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par44' href='#par44'>¶</a>44. (S) Russia believes the system has an engine with a 100&#x000A;ton capacity that uses clustered designs based on old&#x000A;technology, and asked whether the U.S. thought the Taepo&#x000A;Dong-2 uses any new technology.  The U.S. responded that it&#x000A;has not seen any new technology associated with this system.&#x000A;Nevertheless, one path to acquiring a longer range system&#x000A;would be to cluster or stack engines for the new IRBM in the&#x000A;same way North Korea used Scud and No Dong engines in the&#x000A;Taepo Dong-2.  Russia pointed out that so far this has not&#x000A;been observed and there is no new technology associated with&#x000A;an ICBM in North Korea.  The U.S. agreed that no new&#x000A;technology has been observed in the ICBM, but it has been in&#x000A;the IRBM. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par45' href='#par45'>¶</a>45. (S) Russia noted that in its presentations the U.S. had&#x000A;given a range of 10,000 km - 15,000 km with a 500 kg warhead&#x000A;for the Taepo Dong and asked how the U.S. had calculated&#x000A;this.  The U.S. said that for the 10,000 km range, it had&#x000A;assumed a clustered first stage and a No Dong second stage.&#x000A;For the 15,000 km range, it assumed a 3-stage configuration&#x000A;with the same clustered engines and second stage. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par46' href='#par46'>¶</a>46. (S) Taepo Dong-2 and Military Applications &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia pointed out that the Taepo Dong-2 would be hard to use&#x000A;for combat due to a lack of sites and its long launch&#x000A;preparation time.  The U.S. noted that North Korea could&#x000A;mitigate those problems by placing it in a silo or using it&#x000A;as a first strike weapon.  These would not be optimal&#x000A;approaches but if North Korea is sufficiently desperate, it&#x000A;would go with the systems available to it.  Moreover, North&#x000A;Korea puts great political value on these systems.  In the&#x000A;wake of the nuclear test and the UNSCR that followed, North&#x000A;Korea threatened to conduct an ICBM test.  This is another&#x000A;manifestation of the political value of this program for&#x000A;North Korea. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par47' href='#par47'>¶</a>47. (S) North Korean Path to an ICBM &#x000A;&#x000A;The U.S. said it saw three potential paths for North Korea to&#x000A;follow to obtain an ICBM: 1) use the Taepo Dong-2 as an ICBM;&#x000A;2) further develop the technology for an IRBM based on their&#x000A;new MRBM, in the same way the No Dong was a path to the Taepo&#x000A;Dong; and 3) use the very large launch facility that is being&#x000A;constructed on the west coast of North Korea to launch a very&#x000A;large missile.  Russia said that the first two paths could be&#x000A;discussed at a later date. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par48' href='#par48'>¶</a>48. (S) With regard to the third path, Russia wonders whether&#x000A;North Korea is building the new launch site to avoid&#x000A;launching over Japan and for safety reasons.  The U.S.&#x000A;responded that the size of the facility is of concern.  It&#x000A;does not simply replicate other sites.  This facility is much&#x000A;larger than the Taepo Dong launch facility.  This is not to&#x000A;say there is evidence of a new missile system larger than the&#x000A;Taepo Dong-2 being developed, but it suggests the&#x000A;possibility.  North Korea does not spend money on things&#x000A;unless they really matter.  Russia noted that North Korea&#x000A;does not have so much money, so it must economize.  However,&#x000A;Russia can probably agree that the new site is being built to&#x000A;test new missiles.  That said, Russia still thinks North&#x000A;Korea has problems developing more-powerful engines and&#x000A;accurate guidance systems.  This merits further observation&#x000A;and analysis. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par49' href='#par49'>¶</a>49. (S) General Comments &#x000A;&#x000A;Russia said it sees it as significant that Iran and North&#x000A;Korea are trying to buy more materials abroad and trying to&#x000A;get around existing export control regimes.  However, each&#x000A;country is different and Russia cannot say they are working&#x000A;according to the same principles.  On clustering, Russia has&#x000A;a different point of view than the U.S., but will look&#x000A;further into this.  Russia also has a different view on&#x000A;silos, but that can be discussed in more detail next time.&#x000A;In short, North Korea is complex and neither the U.S. nor&#x000A;Russia fully understands its capabilities.  Both sides need&#x000A;to monitor this carefully and work together on this issue. &#x000A;&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- -------------&#x000A;(U) Russian presentation of a framework for evaluating&#x000A;missile risks, dangers and threats; and discussion&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- ------------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par50' href='#par50'>¶</a>50. (S) Nazarov said Russia believes any missile assessments&#x000A;should be based not only on modeling, but also on&#x000A;consideration of the real technical barriers faced by Iran.&#x000A;Serious attention must be given to these technical problems.&#x000A;Otherwise, we will use erroneous assumptions to evaluate the&#x000A;problem.  For example, we can count the number of&#x000A;centrifuges, multiply by production capabilities, and say&#x000A;Iran can produce enough uranium for several warheads.&#x000A;However, this would not be correct because the models do not&#x000A;take into account the technical difficulties in cascade&#x000A;technologies that Iran has not worked out yet. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par51' href='#par51'>¶</a>51. (S) In the same way, Russia thinks that when talking&#x000A;about the Shahab-3, there is no possibility of Iran using&#x000A;these missiles in a launch silo configuration.  Also, Russia&#x000A;does not see Iran increasing the throw weight or range to the&#x000A;declared capabilities.  Thus, as regards attempting to draft&#x000A;a joint report, Russia foresees no problems in an evaluation&#x000A;of the basic systems, but does foresee a difference in the&#x000A;evaluations of the technical barriers faced by the Iranians.&#x000A;With regard to timeframes, Nazarov said that if we talk about&#x000A;real threats, and not just potential challenges, then we need&#x000A;to think about all the systems that need to be developed and&#x000A;tested.  To facilitate this, Russia thinks the JTA&#x000A;discussions should be divided into discussions on missile&#x000A;risks and missile threats.  The two sides should agree on&#x000A;what these are and then work to prevent missile risks from&#x000A;growing into missile threats. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par52' href='#par52'>¶</a>52. (S) Nazarov then asked Vladimir Yermakov, Director for&#x000A;Strategic Capabilities Policy, Russian Ministry of Foreign&#x000A;Affairs, to introduce Russia's proposed methodology for&#x000A;evaluating missile risks and missile threats.  Yermakov said&#x000A;Russia views the December JTA talks as the first step in&#x000A;implementing the goals of the July 2009 Presidential Joint&#x000A;Statement.  These consultations build on many years of work&#x000A;with the U.S. on missile defense, including missile threat&#x000A;assessment, and Russia would like to underscore that the&#x000A;dialogue and close collaboration on missile defense is due to&#x000A;the positive decisions taken by the new administration on&#x000A;missile defense.  Russia's official assessment of Obama's&#x000A;missile defense policy is that it is a step in a positive&#x000A;direction.  Russia commends the U.S. decision to drop the&#x000A;fielding of missile defense elements in Poland and the Czech&#x000A;Republic and replace it with a multi-phased program for&#x000A;missile defense in Europe.  Russia will only be able to give&#x000A;its assessment of the new&#x000A; project after it has seen the implementation of the first&#x000A;phase.  Further collaboration in missile defense will depend&#x000A;on how the project will be developed on the U.S. side.  But a&#x000A;key part of our collaboration will be the joint assessment of&#x000A;missile threats. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par53' href='#par53'>¶</a>53. (S) Continuing, Yermakov said Russia believes that any&#x000A;further practical cooperation on missile defense will be&#x000A;based on a concrete joint assessment of the missile threats.&#x000A;The U.S. and Russia need to have a clear understanding of&#x000A;whom we are cooperating against and we need to make clear&#x000A;distinctions between missile risks, missile challenges, and&#x000A;missile threats.  Russian and U.S. perceptions may coincide&#x000A;and may differ, that is understandable.  We can work together&#x000A;to address threats we both agree on.  But there may be&#x000A;threats the U.S. sees as real and Russia sees only to be&#x000A;perceived ones, and vice versa.  In such cases, the extent of&#x000A;our cooperation may be less or lower, but we can still do&#x000A;something jointly to address these threats as well. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par54' href='#par54'>¶</a>54. (S) Yermakov said that Russia sees as an end-goal of the&#x000A;JTA consultations a document outlining jointly assessed&#x000A;missile threats and challenges.  Naturally, in working on&#x000A;such a document, the U.S. and Russia will recognize that&#x000A;their views differ and those differences will have to be&#x000A;reflected in this document.  We can take as an example our&#x000A;record of cooperation within the NATO Russia Council (NRC). &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par55' href='#par55'>¶</a>55. (S) Yermakov then distributed a paper on a framework of&#x000A;criteria for assessing the level of risk of a given missile&#x000A;program.  He explained that the material on the first page is&#x000A;a graph presented in simplified form in which Russia presents&#x000A;two categories - a threat and a challenge.  In order for&#x000A;there to be a threat, it is necessary to have two components:&#x000A; intention and capabilities.  Only when both components are&#x000A;present does a threat become real.  From the Russian point of&#x000A;view, lack of either component makes the threat hypothetical.&#x000A; When both components are lacking, the threat is only&#x000A;"perceived," and the threat of a nuclear missile strike is&#x000A;zero. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par56' href='#par56'>¶</a>56. (S) Yermakov noted that on the second page, Russia&#x000A;suggests four categories:  missile challenge, missile danger,&#x000A;missile threat, and missile strike.  Russia views a missile&#x000A;challenge as an aspiration to obtain capabilities in the&#x000A;field of rocketry to fulfill one's legitimate national goals.&#x000A; These goals can be a space program or missiles as weapons.&#x000A;A missile danger emerges when nations envision in national&#x000A;guidelines a doctrine that they could/could use missiles.  A&#x000A;missile threat is a more advanced category in which a country&#x000A;has the intention to use its missile capability to further&#x000A;its national military and political goals.  A missile strike&#x000A;is self evident.  Yermakov urged the U.S to review the paper&#x000A;and, at a later stage, provide an assessment of this&#x000A;approach.  At that point, the two sides can compare views,&#x000A;theoretical approaches and assessments of threats, and use&#x000A;this framework to develop a joint document of challenges,&#x000A;risks, and threats. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par57' href='#par57'>¶</a>57. (S) Nazarov thanked Yermakov for his presentation, saying&#x000A;that he believed the U.S. and Russia needed to continue their&#x000A;joint work based on a shared methodology.  The methodology&#x000A;proposed in the Yermakov presentation will allow us to&#x000A;address challenges and threats concretely, and to overcome&#x000A;differences of opinion.  Nazarov said he did not see U.S. and&#x000A;Russian differences as significant for a joint document and&#x000A;thought they could be overcome.  In this context, Russia has&#x000A;prepared  a memorandum with respect to drafting a joint&#x000A;assessment.  The essence of the paper is that the two sides&#x000A;would work together to draft a document on a joint&#x000A;understanding of the problems of missile proliferation.  It&#x000A;would be an assessment of the current trends, conditions, and&#x000A;factors that make up today's situation, and appropriate&#x000A;conclusions. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par58' href='#par58'>¶</a>58.  Nazarov suggested the two sides agree on a timeframe for&#x000A;drafting the document, which would lay the foundation for&#x000A;cooperation and make it more dynamic.  Russia thinks the JTA&#x000A;work could finish by the end of 2010 and believes that&#x000A;following this round, the group could come up with a draft&#x000A;report and then work to improve it and flesh out some of its&#x000A;provisions.  Based on the principle of rotation, Russia also&#x000A;thinks the next round of JTA talks should be in March or&#x000A;April, 2010 in Moscow.  Finally, given the sensitive nature&#x000A;of the eventual final document, it should be treated as&#x000A;confidential and only made available to third parties with&#x000A;the consent of both our parties.  (Passed over non-paper.) &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par59' href='#par59'>¶</a>59. (S) Van Diepen appreciated the thought put into the&#x000A;Russian document and the invitation to Moscow, which he&#x000A;accepted.  He said the U.S. would study the paper and provide&#x000A;comments at a later date.  This will lay the groundwork for&#x000A;productive meetings in Moscow.  However, he also cautioned&#x000A;that the two sides must be careful not to let process get in&#x000A;the way of substance.  He said the U.S. and Russia need to&#x000A;share assessments first and then think about what to do with&#x000A;them.  He also said the two sides should identify the&#x000A;differences in our assessments and the reasons for those&#x000A;differences, rather than get bogged down in wordsmithing and&#x000A;nuances. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par60' href='#par60'>¶</a>60. (C) Nazarov said Russia shares the opinion that the JTA&#x000A;study has a practical goal.  He said Russia is serious about&#x000A;the problem of future missile threats and that the JTA work&#x000A;is under the close scrutiny of the President of the Russian&#x000A;Federation, who demands that the Russia side give an&#x000A;impartial and objective assessment.  Russia believes there is&#x000A;a danger in over- or underestimating the threat as it could&#x000A;prod us to move in the wrong direction.  When it comes to&#x000A;missile and nuclear threats, errors in estimation in both&#x000A;directions are dangerous. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par61' href='#par61'>¶</a>61. (S) Yuriy Korolev, an expert from the Russian Ministry of&#x000A;Foreign Affairs, explained that during a meeting in Budapest&#x000A;in February 2008, Russian experts presented a collection of&#x000A;interesting approaches on assessing missile proliferation&#x000A;threats.  Using that document, Russia thought one could give&#x000A;a more unbiased assessment of missile threats.  However,&#x000A;there has been no reaction from the U.S.  This may be due to&#x000A;the fact that only limited numbers of the document were&#x000A;distributed and they did not reach all appropriate senior&#x000A;U.S. officials.  Russia continues to believe this document is&#x000A;interesting and would appreciate U.S. views, analysis,&#x000A;comments, and proposals on how to make our efforts on&#x000A;countering missile proliferation more effective.  Russia's&#x000A;view is that the methodology presented would make assessments&#x000A;of missile threats more impartial (handed over copies). &#x000A;&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- -------------&#x000A;(U) Russian presentation on the security threat presented by&#x000A;instability and Islamists in Pakistan and discussion&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- ------------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par62' href='#par62'>¶</a>62. (S) Korolev noted that while the focus of the discussions&#x000A;had been on the missile threats from North Korea and Iran,&#x000A;Russia did not think discussion should be limited to only&#x000A;those threats from Iran and North Korea.  In the Russian&#x000A;view, there is another serious threat that should be&#x000A;discussed: Pakistan.  Pakistan is a nation with nuclear&#x000A;weapons, various delivery systems, and a domestic situation&#x000A;that is highly unstable.  Russia assesses that Islamists are&#x000A;not only seeking power in Pakistan but are also trying to get&#x000A;their hands on nuclear materials.  Russia is aware that&#x000A;Pakistani authorities, with help from the U.S., have created&#x000A;a well-structured system of security for protecting nuclear&#x000A;facilities, which includes physical protection.  However,&#x000A;there are 120,000-130,000 people directly involved in&#x000A;Pakistan's nuclear and missile programs, working in these&#x000A;facilities and protecting them.  However, regardless of the&#x000A;clearance process for these people, there is no way to&#x000A;guarantee that all are 100% loyal&#x000A;and reliable. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par63' href='#par63'>¶</a>63. (S) In addition to the Islamist interest in these&#x000A;facilities, Russia also is aware that Pakistan has had to&#x000A;hire people to protect nuclear facilities that have&#x000A;especially strict religious beliefs, and recently the general&#x000A;educational and cultural levels in Pakistan has been falling.&#x000A; Due to these facts, extremist organizations have more&#x000A;opportunities to recruit people working in the nuclear and&#x000A;missile programs.  Over the last few years extremists have&#x000A;attacked vehicles that carry staff to and from these&#x000A;facilities.  Some were killed and a number were abducted and&#x000A;there has been no trace seen of them.  Also, even if places&#x000A;are well protected, transportation of materials is a&#x000A;vulnerable point.  In Pakistan, it is hard to guarantee the&#x000A;security of these materials during transportation.  For these&#x000A;reasons, Russia thinks Pakistan should also be a particular&#x000A;focus of JTA discussion. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par64' href='#par64'>¶</a>64. (S) Nazarov clarified that Russia believes the focus of&#x000A;the JTA discussions should be the missile programs of Iran&#x000A;and North Korea.  Russia assumes the nuclear and missile&#x000A;programs of Pakistan are regionally oriented and thus outside&#x000A;the scope of the current JTA discussion.  However, Russia&#x000A;recently hosted a delegation led by Senators Hagel and&#x000A;Harkin.  The Senators told a meeting of the Russian Security&#x000A;Council that Pakistan poses the greatest threat to the world.&#x000A; Therefore, Russia would appreciate any additional&#x000A;information the U.S. can provide on the actual situation with&#x000A;regard to the protection, storage, and transportation of&#x000A;nuclear and missile weaponry in Pakistan. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par65' href='#par65'>¶</a>65. (C) Van Diepen appreciated Russia's concern with Pakistan&#x000A;and interest in getting further information but noted that&#x000A;the issue as described is primarily nuclear materials being&#x000A;acquired by terrorists, it is more of a nuclear issue and&#x000A;less related to ballistic missiles.  He undertook to report&#x000A;back and facilitate a response from the appropriate office&#x000A;outside the context of the JTA. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par66' href='#par66'>¶</a>66. (S) Nazarov said Russia is interested in using all&#x000A;channels to cooperate with the U.S. on this subject.  First&#x000A;and foremost, Russia is talking about the threat of nuclear&#x000A;terrorism.  If the scenarios include future development, the&#x000A;threat of missile technology getting into the hands of&#x000A;terrorists should also be considered.  Russia would like to&#x000A;put its concern on the record, and particularly with regard&#x000A;to the possibility of Islamists coming to power in Pakistan.&#x000A;Russia would appreciate the U.S. providing additional&#x000A;information on the subject - perhaps at the follow-up meeting&#x000A;in Moscow. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par67' href='#par67'>¶</a>67. (C) Van Diepen said he would report Russia's concerns but&#x000A;noted that the U.S. response would likely come through&#x000A;diplomatic channels rather than at our April/March meetings.&#x000A;He also urged that Nazarov raise his concerns with Special&#x000A;Advisor Holbrooke or his Deputy. &#x000A;&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- -------------&#x000A;(U) Russian presentation on FSB work to interdict Iranian and&#x000A;North Korean attempts to buy restricted technology, or to&#x000A;transship third party materials through Russia&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- ------------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par68' href='#par68'>¶</a>68.  (C) Anatoliy Raikevich, First Deputy Department&#x000A;Director, Federal Security Service (FSB), said that both Iran&#x000A;and North Korea appear to depend heavily on illegally&#x000A;obtaining equipment and technology from abroad for missile&#x000A;and WMD programs.  The FSB has information that Iran and&#x000A;North Korea both have programs to try to acquire Russian&#x000A;technology.  One of the basic tasks of the FSB is to prevent&#x000A;them from acquiring WMD-related production technology in&#x000A;Russia.  To do this, the FSB takes action based on Russian&#x000A;law and export controls.  In particular, the FSB monitors and&#x000A;takes measures to prevent WMD technology exports.  This&#x000A;includes criminal investigations of attempts to export&#x000A;contraband and items on the prohibited list.  Russian&#x000A;analysis shows that that these efforts have significantly&#x000A;reduced the achievements of the Iranian security services in&#x000A;this area.  However, the Iranians continue to try to use the&#x000A;territory of Russia for transits and reexports of such&#x000A;materials. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par69' href='#par69'>¶</a>69. (C) A key effort of the Iranian services is the company&#x000A;to company approach, whereby they use fake companies run by&#x000A;the Iranian security service to procure Russian goods.  The&#x000A;FSB has set up sting companies to uncover Iranian activities.&#x000A; In the past two years, the FSB has cut off a good deal of&#x000A;the exports of such technology. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par70' href='#par70'>¶</a>70. (C) The FSB has determined that Iran is trying to get&#x000A;equipment such as measuring devices, high precision&#x000A;amplifiers, pressure indicators, various composite materials,&#x000A;and technology to create new missile engines from Russia and&#x000A;from sources in Western Europe.  To produce these items&#x000A;itself, Iran would need to seriously modernize its&#x000A;technological base.  To combat this, the FSB must cooperate&#x000A;with the U.S. and European security services.  Russia has&#x000A;many years experience cooperating with U.S. security services&#x000A;and has moved from information exchanges to operational&#x000A;activities.   The FSB thinks U.S. services are very&#x000A;professional and well prepared, and hopes cooperation will&#x000A;continue. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par71' href='#par71'>¶</a>71. (C) Van Diepen thanked Raikevich for his presentation,&#x000A;noting that he had had lots of experience during the 1990s&#x000A;working with Russian counterparts on the problem and trying&#x000A;to reduce the success of Iran in acquiring missile&#x000A;technology.  Van Diepen said he was impressed by the people&#x000A;in Russia working on export controls and appreciated that&#x000A;Russia recognized that Iran is still trying to acquire&#x000A;technology from Russia.  He said he would pass on to U.S.&#x000A;security services the FSB's interest in continued&#x000A;cooperation.  He added that the U.S. would want to work with&#x000A;Russia in those channels as well as in diplomatic channels as&#x000A;the need arose to address specific shipments of concern. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par72' href='#par72'>¶</a>72. (S) Raikevich replied that discussing these issues with&#x000A;the U.S. will help Iran and North Korea to "boil in their own&#x000A;oil."  He said Iran and North Korean may have small successes&#x000A;here and there with procurement, but the FSB will see to it&#x000A;that their successes remain small.  The FSB is grateful for&#x000A;information the U.S. passes along regarding various Russian&#x000A;organizations that may be working with Iran or North Korea,&#x000A;and wants continue to work together to prevent the spread of&#x000A;this technology from Russia and other countries. &#x000A;&#x000A;----------------------&#x000A;(U) Concluding remarks&#x000A;---------------------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par73' href='#par73'>¶</a>73. (S) Yermakov said that Russia thought the discussions had&#x000A;been productive and cooperative.  He noted that both sides&#x000A;have significant homework assignments to complete before the&#x000A;next round and can test the results at the end of&#x000A;March/beginning of April.  He then offered concluding remarks&#x000A;on behalf of the Deputy Secretary of Russia's National&#x000A;Security Council:&#x000A;-- With regard to Iran, Russia believes the possibility of&#x000A;improvement of its liquid propellant missiles is nil. &#x000A;&#x000A;--It is impossible from the Russian point of view for Iran to&#x000A;put a nuclear device on existing missiles with an improved&#x000A;range and throw weight. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Iran has no ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear&#x000A;weapons at this time, and Russia sees no threat from missiles&#x000A;in Iran. &#x000A;&#x000A;--In Russia's view, Iran presents a missile challenge. &#x000A;&#x000A;--A missile threat would only develop if Iran seceded from&#x000A;the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and successfully&#x000A;developed an MRBM with a 3,000 km range and a warhead of one&#x000A;ton. &#x000A;&#x000A;--Iran does not have the military-industrial capability to&#x000A;develop such a program.  If Iran could gain access to foreign&#x000A;technology, it might develop such a program but this is&#x000A;unlikely due to export controls. &#x000A;&#x000A;--In any case, even with the assistance of foreign&#x000A;technology, Russia assesses it will take Iran 6-8 years to&#x000A;gain the ability to launch an MRBM with a nuclear warhead. &#x000A;&#x000A;--With regard to an ICBM, Russia considers this purely&#x000A;hypothetical and does not see the possibility of Iran having&#x000A;this capability for the next 10 years. &#x000A;&#x000A;--For North Korea, Russia assesses that its only real&#x000A;capabilities are outdated missiles with ranges of no more&#x000A;than 3,500 km. &#x000A;&#x000A;--While it is possible to develop missiles with greater&#x000A;ranges based on an SLV program, that would take many years,&#x000A;even with a successful program. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par74' href='#par74'>¶</a>74. (C) Yermakov said these were the basic conclusions Russia&#x000A;wanted to make.  If the conclusions are agreeable to the U.S.&#x000A;side this could be noted.  If not, they can be discussed&#x000A;again at a later date and will be the basis for future work,&#x000A;to continue successful bilateral cooperation.  He said Russia&#x000A;is not at all concerned about differences regarding various&#x000A;aspects of these programs.  Russia sees this as natural.&#x000A;Having differences just means that we need to meet more often&#x000A;and exchange information through appropriate channels.&#x000A;Russia looks forward to a U.S. interagency delegation coming&#x000A;to Moscow.  Until then the two sides can communicate through&#x000A;diplomatic channels or even just by telephone. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par75' href='#par75'>¶</a>75. (S) Van Diepen thanked the Russia side, especially&#x000A;Nazarov, for its thorough preparation and professionalism.&#x000A;He said the U.S. was pleased with the interagency character&#x000A;of the Russian delegation and appreciated that Russia had&#x000A;given a lot of thought to both conceptual issues and&#x000A;technical matters.  The challenge going forward - as shown in&#x000A;the contrast between the technical discussions and Russia's&#x000A;concluding remarks - will be to come to a greater shared&#x000A;understanding of the issues.  On the technical side, there is&#x000A;a fair amount of agreement, but as we go up in range, our&#x000A;views diverge.  Based on common data, we have different&#x000A;perceptions.   The conclusions the U.S. would draw would be&#x000A;different in each case from the conclusions Yermakov&#x000A;outlined.  That is not bad, but both sides need to work to&#x000A;understand the conceptual and technical basis for these&#x000A;views.  There is a great deal to discuss, and we will need to&#x000A;be well prepared for fruitful and informative discussions in&#x000A;Moscow in the spring.  The U.S.&#x000A;will study the Russian papers and follow up through&#x000A;diplomatic channels.  The U.S. also will do its homework&#x000A;assignments, propose specific dates for the next round of&#x000A;talks, and be prepared for "our exams" next time in Moscow. &#x000A;&#x000A;---------------------&#x000A;(U) Participants&#x000A;--------------------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par76' href='#par76'>¶</a>76.
