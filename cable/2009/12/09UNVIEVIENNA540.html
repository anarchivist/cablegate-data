(S) Summary: HFAC staffers Richard Kessler and David Fite &#x000A;received from IAEA Secretariat November 10 information on the &#x000A;Iran case that tracked with the tone of the subsequent &#x000A;Director General's reporting on Iran to the Board of &#x000A;Governors.  The STAFFDEL heard that contact with Iran over &#x000A;"possible military dimensions" of the nuclear program was at &#x000A;an "absolute stalemate."  According to Safeguards regional &#x000A;division director Herman Nackaerts, IAEA inspectors' first &#x000A;visit to the enrichment facility under construction near Qom &#x000A;had run predictably but without extraordinary responsiveness &#x000A;on Iran's part; the Secretariat was still trying to &#x000A;understand the motivation to build the plant as now designed. &#x000A; Nackaerts described the frustrating limitations of Iran's &#x000A;cooperation with the Agency, and the STAFFDEL deduced that &#x000A;Iranian officials held back because they were uncertain about &#x000A;what lines of inquiry the IAEA was best equipped to exploit. &#x000A;Questioning then-DG ElBaradei's remark to media that the &#x000A;Agency had found "nothing to worry about" in Qom, STAFFDEL &#x000A;asked if the Secretariat would report on how it judged the &#x000A;plant did or did not fit into Iran's publicly explained &#x000A;nuclear program.  Nackaerts expressed appreciation for the &#x000A;precision and usefulness of U.S.-supplied information in the &#x000A;Qom case and generally. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2.  (C) Summary contd.: On Syria, Nackaerts said the &#x000A;Secretariat had told Damascus its first explanation for the &#x000A;presence of anthropogenic uranium at the Miniature Neutron &#x000A;Source Reactor was not credible.  Further, the Secretariat &#x000A;still could not yet present the case for how what was being &#x000A;built at Dair Alzour fit in as "part of a Syrian program or &#x000A;part of someone else's program."  On DPRK, IAEA/EXPO's Tariq &#x000A;Rauf said the IAEA, when it could, would ultimately have to &#x000A;"go back to the early 1990s" to reconstruct accountancy of &#x000A;plutonium and could not accept a "political" compromise &#x000A;setting material "off to the side."  To get to a finding of &#x000A;"no diversion" would take several years and extensive &#x000A;resources and forensics. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3.  (SBU) Contd.:  Treating Technical Cooperation, the &#x000A;STAFFDEL received the same briefing on the Safeguards &#x000A;Department's project review process and internal database &#x000A;that was provided to a GAO review team in 2008.  IAEA &#x000A;External Relations Director Rauf asserted, "We are not a &#x000A;denial organization."   STAFFDEL related how segments of the &#x000A;GAO report had reduced Congressional confidence in the &#x000A;efficiency of TC.  U.S. national labs were afforded too &#x000A;little time to review projects for our national &#x000A;decision-making on their merit and proliferation risk. &#x000A;Secretariat also described hindrances it faces in having UN &#x000A;and national development officials recognize and integrate &#x000A;nuclear applications. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4.  (SBU) Contd.:  The STAFFDEL also engaged P5-plus-1 heads &#x000A;of mission over lunch on the means to draw or impel Iran to &#x000A;open up on its nuclear program and on dynamics in Vienna &#x000A;between blocs of Member States.  End Summary. &#x000A; &#x000A;Fordow/Qom and Iran PMD: Frustration, &#x000A;but Good Support from the U.S. &#x000A;------------------------------------- &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5.  (U) House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Majority Staff &#x000A;Director Richard Kessler and Professional Staff Member David &#x000A;Fite (STAFFDEL) spent ninety minutes with IAEA staff on &#x000A;November 10.  Principal issues were safeguards verification &#x000A;in Iran and Syria, the screening of IAEA Technical &#x000A;Cooperation (TC) projects for proliferation risk, and TC &#x000A;Department efforts to improve project design and integration &#x000A;into national and UN development activities.  STAFFDEL &#x000A;affirmed to Secretariat officials that the HFAC under &#x000A;Chairman Berman: was strongly supportive of the IAEA; put &#x000A;emphasis on counter-proliferation issues in countries of &#x000A;concern (indeed, was weighing legislation to impose further &#x000A;U.S. sanctions on Iran); had advocated an increase in NADR &#x000A;funding for extrabudgetary contributions to the IAEA, &#x000A;including for the Safeguards Analytical laboratory; and, &#x000A;supported "getting the U.S. up to date" on payment of its &#x000A;assessments to the IAEA's regular budget.  Following the &#x000A;meeting at the IAEA, STAFFDEL consulted Ambassador and &#x000A;Mission staff and had a working lunch with P5-plus-1 heads of &#x000A;mission focused on Iran and the dynamics of multilateral &#x000A; &#x000A;UNVIE VIEN 00000540  002 OF 005 &#x000A; &#x000A; &#x000A;diplomacy in Vienna.  STAFFDEL's UNVIE program followed a day &#x000A;of consultations with Austrian officials (reftel). &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6.  (SBU) IAEA Safeguards Department Operations B (AOR &#x000A;Mideast, South Asia, parts of Europe, the Americas, and all &#x000A;nuclear weapons states) Director Herman Nackaerts briefed &#x000A;STAFFDEL on the inspection he had led a few weeks before to &#x000A;the recently disclosed Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant near Qom &#x000A;in Iran.  Nackaerts said Iranian officials had been open to &#x000A;allowing inspectors access.  The Secretariat was still trying &#x000A;to understand, he said, why Iran would build this facility, &#x000A;scaled as it was for 3000 centrifuges in contrast to the much &#x000A;large Natanz facility.  It was positive, Nackaerts pointed &#x000A;out, that Fordow was now under safeguards.  He noted that the &#x000A;IAEA had "at least two" safeguards inspectors at work in Iran &#x000A;"every day of the year" and would henceforth plan to visit &#x000A;Fordow regularly.  Asked how "complete" the plant was or when &#x000A;it would be operational, Nackaerts said, "The information we &#x000A;got from Member States proved to be very precise" on this &#x000A;point.  Asked about permission to take samples at Fordow, &#x000A;Nackaerts replied that Iranian officials had permitted the &#x000A;inspectors to perform the same safeguards procedures they &#x000A;typically undertook at Natanz. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7.  (S) STAFFDEL asked if the Agency enjoyed full access to &#x000A;the Arak IR-40 plant.  Nackaerts related there had been no &#x000A;access for a 12-month period but normal access in August and &#x000A;October 2009.  However, the Iranians "claim they cannot go &#x000A;back on the decision of their parliament, and hence grant the &#x000A;IAEA a "visit" but do not call it Design Information &#x000A;Verification.  On possible military dimensions (PMD), &#x000A;Nackaerts said the Secretariat's approach was to follow lines &#x000A;of inquiry that could involve use of nuclear material, for &#x000A;example, the documents treating uranium metal or green salt. &#x000A;The Iranians, he said in a tone conveying his skepticism, &#x000A;asserted the uranium metal document was "mistakenly" included &#x000A;in a packet of information they received from the AQ Khan &#x000A;network but was nothing Iran had asked for or used.  The &#x000A;"green salt" documentation Iran dismissed as a forgery. &#x000A;Indeed, Nackaerts went on, Iran replied basically on the form &#x000A;of documents, not on their substance.  The Secretariat had &#x000A;not been "impressed" by the 117-page rejoinder Iran had &#x000A;provided to the initial presentation of PMD documentation. &#x000A;It had told Iran the information hung together too much for &#x000A;it all to have bee fabricated and asked that, if some of the &#x000A;documentation were "doctored," Iranian officials should show &#x000A;the Secretariat "where the truth ends."  Since August 2008, &#x000A;(when Ahmadinejad personally shut off Nackaerts's previously &#x000A;approved visit to workshops indicated in the documentation), &#x000A;Nackaerts concluded, there remained a high-level decision not &#x000A;to cooperate.  STAFFDEL member Fite took from this that the &#x000A;Iranians were holding back "because they don't know where any &#x000A;opening will lead."  Nackaerts agreed, saying they knew that &#x000A;every question they answered would bring another question. &#x000A; &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8.  (S) Fite alluded to then-DG ElBaradei's remarks of a few &#x000A;days before in U.S. media to the effect that the inspectors &#x000A;had found "nothing to worry about" in Fordow.  Acknowledging &#x000A;the practical meaning of this remark -- that there were no &#x000A;centrifuges or nuclear material present -- Fite nevertheless &#x000A;regretted the headline and asked if the DG's formal report to &#x000A;Board members (Note: subsequently released as GOV/2009/74, &#x000A;deresticted by the Board November 27, and available to the &#x000A;public at www.iaea.org) would deal with how Qom fits or does &#x000A;not fit into Iran's explained nuclear program.  Nackaerts &#x000A;replied, "We will identify the issues we're working."  He &#x000A;went on that understanding the timeline of Fordow's &#x000A;development was hindered by Iran's practice never to involve &#x000A;people who really know the facts or the government's &#x000A;intentions in discussion with the Agency.  The officials with &#x000A;whom inspectors meet clearly are "steered" by unseen &#x000A;observers, who send notes to the Iranian interlocutors during &#x000A;meetings.  Iran recorded the meetings, he added, but did not &#x000A;permit the IAEA to do so.  Further, the Secretariat never &#x000A;received original design documents, but ones produced for the &#x000A;Secretariat that were technically true to the facilities they &#x000A;found upon inspection.  Against this Iranian practice, &#x000A;Nackaerts added, the Secretariat received very precise &#x000A;information from Member States that helped inspectors decide &#x000A;what to ask about.  The organization of this information was &#x000A;good and, while the Agency was satisfied, it had inquired if &#x000A;more information could be shared with the Agency, "not &#x000A;necessarily for release to Iran," he said. &#x000A; &#x000A;Syria Stalemate &#x000A; &#x000A;UNVIE VIEN 00000540  003 OF 005 &#x000A; &#x000A; &#x000A;--------------- &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9.  (SBU) The Syria case, Nackaerts said, was starting to &#x000A;look like Iran in that the government provided "good &#x000A;cooperation" on some areas but presented a "stalemate" on &#x000A;others.  The Secretariat challenged Syria's proposed &#x000A;explanation for the presence of uranium at Dair Alzour/Al &#x000A;Kibar (i.e., that Israeli depleted uranium munitions could be &#x000A;the source), but the inquiry was at a roadblock.  Syrian &#x000A;officials had been told their first explanation for &#x000A;anthropogenic uranium at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor &#x000A;(MNSR) was not credible, and the Agency had inquired what &#x000A;nuclear material Syria could have had that was not previously &#x000A;declared.  Overall, the IAEA still "did not understand" &#x000A;(meaning, it could not yet present the solid case for) how &#x000A;Dair Alzour fit in as part of a Syrian nuclear program "or &#x000A;part of someone else's program." &#x000A; &#x000A;Return to DPRK? &#x000A;Safeguards in India? &#x000A;-------------------- &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10.  (SBU) Asked how quickly IAEA inspectors could resume &#x000A;work in North Korea if re-admitted by the government, Tariq &#x000A;Rauf of IAEA External Relations and Policy Coordination &#x000A;(EXPO) observed that the last resumption had taken a week &#x000A;(for technical set-up, re-activation of cameras, etc.). &#x000A;Safeguards Operations A division had a program set out for &#x000A;what steps to undertake "under circumstances the DPRK may let &#x000A;us back in."  Rauf continued that the Agency would to go back &#x000A;to the early 1990s' plutonium revelation to reconstruct &#x000A;material accountancy.  When most recently in the DPRK, the &#x000A;IAEA had been monitoring facility shutdown processes but not &#x000A;implementing NPT safeguards on DPRK material.  The Agency &#x000A;could "not accept" political compromises that would set some &#x000A;nuclear material "off to the side".  Then-DG ElBaradei had &#x000A;called for implementation of the Additional Protocol in DPRK, &#x000A;but even if Pyongyang cooperated fully it would take several &#x000A;years and much in the way of resources and forensics to be &#x000A;able to get to a finding of "no diversion." &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11.  (SBU) Asked about progress toward safeguards &#x000A;implementation in India, Rauf confirmed the GOI had submitted &#x000A;a "formal list" of facilities that was not a document the &#x000A;Agency would characterize as a formal declaration under its &#x000A;safeguards agreement.  India was under no mandatory timeline &#x000A;to make its declaration as it was not an NPT signatory. &#x000A;(Comment: Rauf's characterization was flat wrong.  Mission &#x000A;had learned from the Safeguards Department three weeks before &#x000A;this meeting that India had officially "notified" two new &#x000A;facilities (Raps 5 and 6) under its 2008 safeguards &#x000A;agreement, that surveillance systems had been installed, and &#x000A;the facilities were under safeguards.  End Comment.) &#x000A; &#x000A;Scrutinizing and Promoting &#x000A;IAEA Technical Cooperation &#x000A;-------------------------- &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12.  (U) Renaud Chatelus of the Safeguards Division of &#x000A;Information Management (SGIM) acquainted STAFFDEL with IAEA &#x000A;screening of Technical Cooperation (TC) projects for their &#x000A;potential to afford access to sensitive technologies. &#x000A;Grounded in a 1979 Agency Information Circular, INFCIRC/267, &#x000A;the practice is to focus on projects related to enrichment, &#x000A;heavy water production, reprocessing of spent fuel, and &#x000A;plutonium or mixed oxide fuel.  Chatelus said SGIM reviewed &#x000A;projects submitted, project approved, individual procurement &#x000A;actions, and overall implementation of projects.  Reviews are &#x000A;conducted completely in-house, he said in reply to a &#x000A;question.  Using the same PowerPoint slides that were &#x000A;presented to a GAO review team in 2008, Chatelus illustrated &#x000A;with screen shots from the Agency's staff access-only &#x000A;database the system of flagging projects for: compliance with &#x000A;INFCIRC 267, compliance with INFCIRC 540 (Additional &#x000A;Protocol), transfer of "sensitive items" on the Nuclear &#x000A;Suppliers Group or dual-use lists, general interest, or &#x000A;possible relation to a safeguarded facility.  In subsequent &#x000A;discussion of the impact of screening and Member States' &#x000A;sense of entitlement to TC, EXPO's Tariq Rauf affirmed, "We &#x000A;are not a denial organization." &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13.  (U) STAFFDEL member Fite observed that segments of the &#x000A;GAO report treating transfers to state sponsors of terrorism &#x000A;as well as on program management had reduced Congressional &#x000A;confidence about TC.  Fite said he had approached &#x000A;Appropriations staff about using a supplemental funding bill &#x000A; &#x000A;UNVIE VIEN 00000540  004 OF 005 &#x000A; &#x000A; &#x000A;to resolve slow U.S. payment of assessments and do more for &#x000A;the Agency, but was rebuffed because the GAO report on TC had &#x000A;"poisoned the waters."  Apart from political objections to &#x000A;certain TC recipients benefitting from U.S. funding, he &#x000A;added, a persisting "Achilles heel" was that U.S. national &#x000A;labs were afforded too little time to review projects for our &#x000A;national decision-making on their merit and proliferation &#x000A;risk.  TC Department representative Johannes Seybold replied &#x000A;that the Agency aimed to provide Member States six weeks time &#x000A;for review, but was also at the mercy of requesting states &#x000A;providing the relevant project information.  Just the &#x000A;compendium of project titles and short descriptions became a &#x000A;very thick document in each biennial cycle, Seybold went on, &#x000A;and the Agency was "struggling" with some Member States' &#x000A;national policies to be able to go beyond this level of &#x000A;transparency. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14.  (U) STAFFDEL's meeting with Secretariat officials &#x000A;concluded in an exchange with Seybold, TC's section head for &#x000A;strategy and partnerships, about the IAEA's awkward position &#x000A;in development efforts coordinated by the UN or by developing &#x000A;countries' national institutions.  Seybold laid out the &#x000A;following.  The IAEA's cooperation with TC recipient states &#x000A;occurs through National Liaison Officers, generally in the &#x000A;atomic energy commission or government ministry responsible &#x000A;for nuclear power or radiological sources.  Generally, &#x000A;neither the IAEA nor the corresponding national entity is a &#x000A;participant in UN development team or host government &#x000A;deliberations about development in the recipient country. &#x000A;Two-thirds of TC projects address development issues for &#x000A;which the IAEA is not the responsible lead agency in the UN &#x000A;system, e.g., water quality and availability, food security, &#x000A;climate.  In many cases, national authorities and the UN team &#x000A;responsible for these areas in a given country lack awareness &#x000A;of IAEA capabilities, and/or they maintain a distance from &#x000A;things "nuclear."  Seybold related Agency efforts to &#x000A;integrate with these authorities through the UNDAF (UN &#x000A;Development Assistance Framework) process and other &#x000A;partnering efforts.  STAFFDEL expressed encouragement for &#x000A;bringing nuclear applications to greater impact in the &#x000A;development field. &#x000A; &#x000A;P5-plus-1 Ambassadors Regret Iranian Paralysis &#x000A;on TRR; Depict Grim Dynamic with G-77/NAM &#x000A;--------------------------------------------- - &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15.  (C) STAFFDEL was the guests of honor at lunch hosted by &#x000A;the Ambassador with his counterparts from China, Germany, &#x000A;Russia, and the UK and the French Charge d'Affaires.  Kessler &#x000A;and Fite laid out HFAC's interest and Chairman Berman's &#x000A;supportive posture toward the Agency, as they had for &#x000A;Secretariat staff.  Opening discussion of Iran, UK Ambassador &#x000A;Simon Smith said the Iranian answer on the ElBaradei-brokered &#x000A;deal on refueling the Tehran research reactor (TRR) "had to &#x000A;be 'yes' or 'no,' not waffling" as it had been.  German &#x000A;Ambassador Ruediger Luedeking posited that the U.S. &#x000A;Administration had confounded Iranian internal processes and &#x000A;the latest EU3 proposal had "cornered" Iran.  Agreeing that &#x000A;Iran faced an imperative between "yes" and "no," Luedeking &#x000A;observed, "they can't answer."  HFAC Staff Director Kessler &#x000A;noted the committee had tried to follow up a Larijani &#x000A;approach conveyed one year before for a meeting with Chairman &#x000A;Berman, but found that the Iranians backed off. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16.  (C) Russian Ambassador Alexander Zmeyevskiy asserted &#x000A;that confidentiality was a major concern for Iran.  He noted &#x000A;its TRR counter-proposals, either to keep its LEU on its &#x000A;territory under IAEA safeguards until released in exchange &#x000A;for fuel rods, or to swap outgoing LEU piecemeal for incoming &#x000A;fuel assemblies.  Moving beyond the TRR issue, UK Ambassador &#x000A;said he was severely disappointed that Member States had been &#x000A;unable to "apply consequences for the breaking of rules" of &#x000A;the organization.  We needed to convince some other Member &#x000A;States, he continued, that tolerating rule breaking as on Qom &#x000A;and Code 3.1 (of the Subsidiary Arrangement of Iran's &#x000A;Safeguards Agreement) risked bringing the organization into &#x000A;discredit.  STAFFDEL member Fite asked if Iran's Arab &#x000A;neighbors were among the problem interlocutors in Vienna; he &#x000A;asserted that officials of Arabian Peninsula countries told &#x000A;the Congress they see Iran as an "existential threat."  While &#x000A;they may seek the cover of international signals or sanctions &#x000A;imposed by others, they say they do want action against Iran. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17.  (C) Segueing from Iran to DPRK, Chinese Ambassador Hu &#x000A;Xiaodi said the main difference between the cases was that &#x000A;progress with DPRK had been achieved when the North Koreans &#x000A; &#x000A;UNVIE VIEN 00000540  005 OF 005 &#x000A; &#x000A; &#x000A;wanted something specific, whereas he (Hu) had never heard &#x000A;Iranian officials say that they wanted a settlement, or that &#x000A;they wanted anything specific.  Although we did not at &#x000A;present know "how" to reach a deal with Iran, Hu concluded, &#x000A;we were not in the worst situation, in which Iran explicitly &#x000A;does want something -- nuclear weapons.  Asked if he &#x000A;genuinely thought the DPRK would give up its weapons program &#x000A;for aid, Hu said "hope" (as opposed to "think.")   Ambassador &#x000A;Davies seriously questioned that Pyongyang would give up a &#x000A;weapons capability in exchange for a significant material &#x000A;improvement in our relations, as the government would likely &#x000A;calculate it had been its possession of weapons that won the &#x000A;concessions. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18.  (SBU) Ambassador turned the discussion to the dynamic &#x000A;between groups of Member States, as illustrated in the &#x000A;ongoing discussion of a Technical Cooperation project to &#x000A;advance IAEA use of "results based management."  The German &#x000A;Ambassador observed that NAM positions on many issues were &#x000A;characterized by "myths" and they were clearly being dictated &#x000A;by Iran and Egypt.  Ambassador Davies asked if the dynamic &#x000A;was further charged by states beginning to suspect that the &#x000A;U.S. seriously intends to strengthen the Agency in all its &#x000A;functions -- with the uncertain shifts in practice and &#x000A;distribution of resources and clout that could mean. &#x000A;STAFFDEL lead Kessler said the Congressional perception was &#x000A;one of a "lightning change" from the last Administration to &#x000A;the present one in U.S. approaches to the IAEA, to &#x000A;development assistance globally, and to multilateralism. &#x000A;German Ambassador agreed and said this was a complication for &#x000A;NAM states that know they are the immobile ones now.  Yet, TC &#x000A;was a "sacred cow" and the NAM's impulse was to reject &#x000A;"illegitimate intrusion" into its distribution. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19.  (SBU) French Charge Philippe Merlin discouraged STAFFDEL &#x000A;from expecting diplomatic gains, say in the NPT review, &#x000A;through greater generosity on IAEA peaceful use programs. &#x000A;"TC is the price we pay," he said, for developing countries' &#x000A;acquiescence toward the safeguards regime, the thing we &#x000A;really want.  Fite asked if a reasoned discussion with &#x000A;development officials in capitals about making TC deliver &#x000A;more impact could translate into different instructions to &#x000A;the obstreperous missions in Vienna.  German Ambassador took &#x000A;the view that any effort to change TC would be seen in &#x000A;capitals as "per se bad."  It was more advisable to advocate &#x000A;to NAM states what their own interests in the safeguards &#x000A;regime were.  UK Ambassador agreed there were no points to be &#x000A;scored by asking NAM capitals about TC effectiveness; he &#x000A;added that the UK Government "doesn't give two hoots" about &#x000A;TC, given the small funding level (from the UK Energy &#x000A;Ministry) in comparison to Britain's official development &#x000A;assistance.  TC was, also in the UK view, the price we pay &#x000A;for the IAEA we want. &#x000A; &#x000A;<a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20.  (U) STAFFDEL did not review this report. &#x000A; &#x000A; &#x000A;DAVIES</pre></code>
