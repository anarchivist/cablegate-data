(U) SUMMARY. President Zapatero's center-left Spanish&#x000A;Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) was the victor in the March 9&#x000A;general election. This cable gives brief biographies for the&#x000A;cabinet members in Zapatero's second administration.&#x000A;Overall, the cabinet reflects Zapatero's campaign promises to&#x000A;focus on innovation, equality and the environment. This is&#x000A;the first Spanish cabinet with more women than men. Several&#x000A;key players from the first Zapatero administration will keep&#x000A;their jobs, including Vice Presidents de la Vega and Solbes,&#x000A;Foreign Minister Moratinos, and Interior Minister Rubalcaba.&#x000A;An important change is the shift of Carme Chacon from&#x000A;Minister of Housing to Minister of Defense. Two new&#x000A;Ministries have been added: a Ministry of Equality and a&#x000A;Ministry of Science and Innovation. Other Ministries were&#x000A;restructured. For example, The Ministries of Environment and&#x000A;Agriculture merged. The Ministry of Education, Social&#x000A;Affairs and Sports restructured to include social affairs,&#x000A;but gave up its science portfolio. The Labor Ministry&#x000A;assumed responsibility for immigration affairs. Biographies&#x000A;will be posted to the Embassy Madrid Intellipedia page for&#x000A;future reference and periodic updates. END SUMMARY.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (U) Zapatero's new cabinet is:&#x000A;First Vice President for the Presidency Maria Teresa&#x000A;Fernandez de la Vega;&#x000A;Second Vice President for Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes;&#x000A;Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Angel Moratinos;&#x000A;Minister of Justice Mariano Fernandez Bermejo;&#x000A;Minister of Defense Carme Chacon;&#x000A;Minister of Interior Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba;&#x000A;Minster of Public Administration Elena Salgado;&#x000A;Minister of Public Works (Fomento) Magdalena Alvarez;&#x000A;Minister of Environment and Marine and Rural Environs&#x000A;(Agriculture) Elena Espinosa;&#x000A;Minister of Equality Bibiana Aido;&#x000A;Minister of Education, Social Affairs and Sport Mercedes&#x000A;Cabrera;&#x000A;Minister of Labor and Immigration Celestino Corbacho;&#x000A;Minister of Industry, Tourism and Commerce Miguel Sebastian;&#x000A;Minister of Science and Innovation Cristina Garmendia;&#x000A;Minister of Housing Beatriz Corredor; and&#x000A;Minister of Health Bernat Soria;&#x000A;Minister of Culture Cesar Antonio Molina.&#x000A;&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- ----&#x000A;Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega&#x000A;First Vice President, Minister of the Presidency,&#x000A;and Spokesperson of the Government&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- -----&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (U) Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega continues as First&#x000A;Vice President for a second term. In 2004, she became the&#x000A;first woman to occupy a Vice Presidency in Spain. As Vice&#x000A;President and Minister of the Presidency, de la Vega&#x000A;coordinates the "political" ministries with a primary focus&#x000A;on Justice, Defense, Equality, Education and Foreign Affairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (U) During the 2000-2004 legislature, de la Vega served as&#x000A;PSOE Secretary General in Congress and led the opposition&#x000A;party's attacks against the PP's Aznar administration. In&#x000A;this position, she also coordinated the PSOE members in&#x000A;Congress to achieve a unified legislative program. She has&#x000A;been elected as Congresswoman three times: in 1996 for Jaen,&#x000A;in 2000 for Segovia, and in 2004 for Madrid.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5. (U) From 1994-96 de la Vega served as Secretary of State&#x000A;for Justice with Justice Minister Alberto Belloch, a position&#x000A;she held until 1996. During that time she managed the&#x000A;reform of the Penal Code. De la Vega promoted the active&#x000A;participation of State prosecutors in criminal investigation,&#x000A;while maintaining the ultimate control of magistrates in the&#x000A;judicial process.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6. (U) De la Vega began her political career with the Catalan&#x000A;Socialist Party, but in 1979 moved her affiliation to a&#x000A;political movement called "Justicia Democratica", a group of&#x000A;judges, prosecutors, and lawyers that played an important&#x000A;role in Spain's transition to democracy after Franco's&#x000A;regime. When the Socialist Party (PSOE) won its first&#x000A;national elections in 1982, de la Vega served as Chief of&#x000A;Cabinet to Socialist Minister of Justice Fernando Ledesma.&#x000A;In 1985 she was appointed Director General of Services in the&#x000A;Justice Ministry and under her leadership the number of&#x000A;judges doubled. From 1988 to 1990 she worked in the&#x000A;Secretariat of Labor Magistrates and in 1990 she was&#x000A;appointed spokesperson of the General Council of Judicial&#x000A;&#x000A;MADRID 00000552 002.2 OF 011&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Authority.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7. (U) She was born in Valencia in 1949. She studied Law and&#x000A;received her PhD from the University of Barcelona. She&#x000A;taught Labor Law at the University of Barcelona. She is a&#x000A;specialist in Human Rights and International Juridical&#x000A;Cooperation with additional training from the University of&#x000A;Strasbourg.&#x000A;&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- -----&#x000A;Pedro Solbes&#x000A;Second Vice President and Minister of Economy and Finance&#x000A;--------------------------------------------- -----&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8. (U) As Vice President for Economic Affairs, Solbes is&#x000A;supposed to exercise control over all the economic decisions&#x000A;of the GOS, except foreign and domestic trade, tourism, and&#x000A;energy, which fall to the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and&#x000A;Commerce.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9. (SBU) Solbes had reportedly seriously considered leaving&#x000A;the government at the end of Zapatero's previous term. He is&#x000A;65, and his wife wanted him to retire. Zapatero convinced&#x000A;him to stay, and his presence on the ticket was considered to&#x000A;be an important appeal to the business community, some of&#x000A;whose members have portrayed Solbes as the only bulwark&#x000A;preventing Socialist ministers from overspending. Zapatero&#x000A;is reported to have promised Solbes increased authority.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10. (SBU) In Zapatero's first term, Solbes often was at odds&#x000A;with the economic office of the presidency, which tended to&#x000A;favor more interventionist policies. Sebastian has now been&#x000A;named Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce, and&#x000A;individuals linked to Sebastian have been named to other&#x000A;ministries. After Sebastian's appointment was announced,&#x000A;Solbes told the press, "I am the Economic Vice President. I&#x000A;am the one who makes decisions on economic policy. I am the&#x000A;one who signs the economic draft laws. This is a coalition&#x000A;government between me and the rest." Solbes had clashed with&#x000A;Sebastian in 2005-06 over the German company E.ON's bid to&#x000A;acquire Spain's Endesa; Solbes had not objected to the bid,&#x000A;while Sebastian influenced GOS attempts to block the bid and&#x000A;later helped broker the eventually successful purchase by&#x000A;Italy's Acciona and Spain's Acciona. After Zapatero was&#x000A;re-elected, Solbes had reportedly asked Zapatero to give him&#x000A;the energy portfolio as well, but the portfolio remained in&#x000A;Sebastian's ministry.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11. (U) Solbes has traditionally emphasized the importance&#x000A;of fiscal responsibility and maintaining Spain's budget&#x000A;surplus. With the economy expected to grow much more slowly&#x000A;in 2008, unemployment rising, and inflation relatively high,&#x000A;he will face pressure to spend more, and he has emphasized&#x000A;for months that the budget surpluses of Zapatero's first four&#x000A;years have given the GOS more margin to maneuver in the&#x000A;difficult times expected ahead. He already has announced 10&#x000A;billion euros in tax cuts and spending increases for 2008,&#x000A;with about 8 billion expected for 2009. He also will be&#x000A;expected to address the housing slowdown, which has increased&#x000A;unemployment and caused serious difficulties for construction&#x000A;and real estate firms, along with their creditors.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12. (U) A civil servant since 1968, Solbes, in 1982 as&#x000A;Technical Secretary General, was one of the seven people who&#x000A;negotiated Spanish accession to the European Community. He&#x000A;was Secretary General of Economy and Finance from 1982 to&#x000A;1985 and Secretary of State for European Community Relations&#x000A;starting in 1985. He was named Minister of Agriculture, Food&#x000A;and Fisheries in 1991 and Minister of Economy and Finance in&#x000A;<a id='par1993' href='#par1993'>¶</a>1993. In September 1999, Solbes became the European&#x000A;Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs.&#x000A;He earned praise for his sense of duty and his courage for&#x000A;denouncing the institutional rupture that occurred when the&#x000A;Council of Ministers refused to sanction France and Germany&#x000A;for exceeding European Stability & Growth Pact budget deficit&#x000A;limits.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13. (U) Pedro Solbes was born in Pinoso (Alicante province)&#x000A;in 1942. He graduated in European economy from the&#x000A;Universite Libre de Bruxelles and earned a degree in law and&#x000A;a doctoral degree in Political Science from the Complutense&#x000A;University of Madrid. He is married to Pilar Castro&#x000A;Rodriguez and has three children (Teresa, Miguel and Lucia).&#x000A;He speaks French and English.&#x000A;&#x000A;---------------------------&#x000A;Miguel Angel Moratinos&#x000A;Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x000A;&#x000A;MADRID 00000552 003.2 OF 011&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;---------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14. (U) Moratinos begins his second term in the Cabinet as&#x000A;the Spanish democracy's second-longest serving Foreign&#x000A;Minister. In the presidential investiture debate, Zapatero&#x000A;said that one of his priorities will be the Sub-Saharan&#x000A;Africa and in next few months, Moratinos is tasked with&#x000A;arranging high-level summits with Morocco and Algeria.&#x000A;Moratinos traveled to several Latin America countries in&#x000A;April to forge ties in advance of the May EU-Latin America&#x000A;Summit. Some of the pending issues Moratinos faces from the&#x000A;last legislature are Spanish foreign service reform,&#x000A;development assistance credits reform, and construction of a&#x000A;new building to house his Ministry, which is currently in&#x000A;leased spaces.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15. (SBU) Moratinos was one of the key players behind the&#x000A;Madrid 1991 Peace Conference and considers himself an expert&#x000A;in Middle East policy. From 1991 to 1993, he was Director&#x000A;General of the Institute for Cooperation with the Arab World.&#x000A;From 1993 to 1996 he was Director General of Foreign Policy&#x000A;for North Africa and the Middle East. During the 1995&#x000A;Spanish EU Presidency, Moratinos managed all Middle East&#x000A;policy issues and was a frequent interlocutor with&#x000A;Washington. In June 1996, he was appointed Ambassador to&#x000A;Israel, a position he held for only six months. In December&#x000A;1996, he was appointed Special Representative of the European&#x000A;Union (EUSR) for the Middle East Peace Process. Moratinos&#x000A;managed the EU's relationship with Israel and Palestine, as&#x000A;well as other states in the region like Syria, Lebanon,&#x000A;Jordan, and Egypt. However, he created a perception that he&#x000A;maintained closer ties with Yassar Arafat than with Prime&#x000A;Minister Sharon. While Moratinos participated in the MEPP&#x000A;Quartet meetings, Israelis reportedly considered Moratinos&#x000A;excessively favorable to the Palestinian cause. Moratinos&#x000A;left the EUSR position in July 2003. His name was mentioned&#x000A;as a possible candidate for the UN High Commission for Human&#x000A;Rights following the death of Sergio Vieria de Mello.&#x000A;However, in October 2003 Moratinos returned to the Ministry&#x000A;of Foreign Affairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16. (U) Moratinos began his diplomatic career as Spain's&#x000A;Chief Director for the Eastern European Coordination Desk in&#x000A;1974-1979. He was First Secretary at the Spanish Embassy in&#x000A;Yugoslavia, where he later served as Charge d'Affaires from&#x000A;1980-1984. He was Political Advisor in Rabat (1984-1987) and&#x000A;Deputy Director General of North African Affairs in the&#x000A;Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1987-1991).&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17. (U) Moratinos joined the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE)&#x000A;in 2000 and in 2004 and 2008 won election as a Congressional&#x000A;delegate representing his hometown of Cordoba.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18. (U) Miguel Angel Moratinos was born in 1951. Moratinos&#x000A;holds a degree in law and political science and a diploma in&#x000A;international studies from the Spanish Diplomatic School. He&#x000A;is fluent in English and French. He understands Russian and&#x000A;Serbo-Croatian.&#x000A;&#x000A;--------------------------&#x000A;Mariano Fernandez Bermejo&#x000A;Minister of Justice&#x000A;--------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19. (U) Mariano Fernandez Bermejo was appointed Minister of&#x000A;Justice in February 9, 2007, and is retained as a member of&#x000A;the new cabinet. The strong recommendation of Vice&#x000A;President Fernandez de la Vega ensured Fernandez Bermejo's&#x000A;appointment and he is expected to strengthen rapport and&#x000A;cooperation between the Ministry, the Prosecutor's Office and&#x000A;the Interior Ministry. He is reported to have a good working&#x000A;relationship with Interior Minister Rubalcaba and Secretary&#x000A;of State for Security Antonio Camacho.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20. (SBU) As a founding member of the Progressive Union of&#x000A;Public Prosecutors, Fernandez Bermejo is considered to be the&#x000A;guardian of the PSOE's judicial policy. Fernandez Bermejo&#x000A;will manage and attempt to inject change into a judicial&#x000A;system in which some "conservative" judges have not been&#x000A;supportive of GOS-sponsored initiatives, including homosexual&#x000A;marriage and autonomous community statutes.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21. (U) First-ranked in his professional certification exams,&#x000A;he began his career as a prosecutor in 1974 in Santa Cruz de&#x000A;Tenerife, then worked in territorial courts in Caceres and&#x000A;Segovia. From 1986 to 1989 he was Advisor to Minister of&#x000A;Justice Fernando Ledesma. In 1989, he was appointed&#x000A;Prosecutor of the Supreme Court. From 1992-2003, Fernandez&#x000A;&#x000A;MADRID 00000552 004.2 OF 011&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Bermejo served as Chief Prosecutor of the Madrid High Court&#x000A;of Justice. In 2004, he became Prosecutor of the Supreme&#x000A;Court.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22. (SBU) Fernandez Bermejo is known for taking tough stands&#x000A;and speaking out on issues. He is the only prosecutor who&#x000A;has taken a Minister to Court. In another example, when he&#x000A;led opposition to the Rapid Justice Law, the PP-led&#x000A;government retaliated by passing a law limiting prosecutors&#x000A;to five-year terms instead of lifetime appointments&#x000A;(effectively moving Fernandez Bermejo along in the system).&#x000A;Expressing his unhappiness with the PP maneuver at the time,&#x000A;Fernandez Bermejo said, referring to the Spanish Civil War&#x000A;and Franco's regime, "we fought against the parents, and now&#x000A;we have to fight against their children."&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23. (SBU) He is considered to be a strong personality, not&#x000A;given to conciliation, and with a tendency to harsh&#x000A;assessments. "I am a leftist, and I behave like one," he&#x000A;admits. Perhaps due to these traits, Fernandez Bermejo has&#x000A;not received the support of the Concejo Fiscal, the advisory&#x000A;body that reviews judicial appointments, in either of his&#x000A;positions at the High Court or Supreme Court. According to&#x000A;the media, many Ministry of Justice civil servants, the&#x000A;judicial secretaries, and the judges believe that Fernandez&#x000A;Bermejo, while focused on policy matters, has not fulfilled&#x000A;his promises on wages or work conditions.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24. (U) Born in 1948 in Avila, Fernandez Bermejo received a&#x000A;Doctorate in Law from the Complutense University in 1969,&#x000A;followed by an advanced degree in Community Law in 1998. A&#x000A;Public Prosecutor since 1974, he is an expert on Penal Law.&#x000A;Fernandez Bermejo does not speak English.&#x000A;&#x000A;----------------------------------&#x000A;Carme Chacon (new in this Ministry)&#x000A;Minister of Defense&#x000A;----------------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25. (U) Carme Chacon is the first woman Minister of Defense&#x000A;in Spanish history. She served as Housing Minister from 2007&#x000A;to 2008 and also was First Vice President of Congress from&#x000A;2004-2007. Her cabinet appointment was the surprise in&#x000A;Zapatero's second administration amidst widely varying&#x000A;speculation regarding who might be awarded the plum job.&#x000A;Zapatero made it clear he intended to put in place a broadly&#x000A;representative cabinet and Chacon brings ties to the Catalan&#x000A;constituency as well her deep-rooted PSOE political&#x000A;credentials. Jose Montilla, Secretary General of the Catalan&#x000A;Socialist Party (PSC) has been one of Chacon's strongest&#x000A;supporters. Chacon was one of the PSC members of Zapatero's&#x000A;"new team" after he won the PSOE party congress in 2000.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26. (SBU) Chacon lacks experience in military affairs (the&#x000A;same could be said of most of her predecessors), but she is&#x000A;reportedly viewed by Zapatero as a strong manager. Chacon&#x000A;was quick to visit Spanish troops deployed in Afghanistan and&#x000A;Lebanon and she is expected to visit Kosovo in the near&#x000A;future. Chacon served as an OSCE international observer in&#x000A;Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1996 and Albania in 1997. Her other&#x000A;credentials include representing the Socialist delegation in&#x000A;Spain's bipartisan Anti-terrorism Pact. She reportedly has a&#x000A;strong rapport with Interior Minister Rubalcaba.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27. (SBU) There was some buzz in conservative circles about&#x000A;Zapatero choosing a MOD who was a "pacifist." Asked about&#x000A;the label in a recent newspaper interview, Chacon said, in&#x000A;essence, that if being a pacifist meant valuing peace, then&#x000A;she was a pacifist. She went on to express her admiration&#x000A;for the Spanish troops she had just visited in Afghanistan.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28. (SBU) Chacon's priorities will reportedly be the&#x000A;Spanish military missions abroad, modernization, and&#x000A;personnel restructuring. The personnel restructuring will be&#x000A;a particular challenge as some senior officials disagree with&#x000A;plans to reduce the number of generals and there is&#x000A;controversy over proposals to adjust Spanish troop levels in&#x000A;Ceuta and Melilla.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29. (U) Carme Chacon was born in Espulgues de Llobregat,&#x000A;Barcelona, in 1971. She has a Law Degree from the University&#x000A;of Barcelona (1994) and a PhD Cum Laude for a thesis on&#x000A;federalism and human rights. Her post-graduate studies&#x000A;include: Victoria Manchester University (UK), Instituto de&#x000A;Federalismo de Friburgo (Switzerland), Osgoode Hall Law&#x000A;School of Toronto, University of Kingston, and the Universite&#x000A;Laval of Montreal (Canada). She has been professor of&#x000A;Constitutional Law at the University of Girona, Spain. She is&#x000A;&#x000A;MADRID 00000552 005.2 OF 011&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;an expert in federalism and Quebec's status within Canada.&#x000A;She is married to Miguel Barroso, the Director of Casa&#x000A;America and himself a Zapatero insider. They are expecting&#x000A;their first child in June. Chacon speaks English.&#x000A;&#x000A;-----------------------&#x000A;Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba&#x000A;Minister of Interior&#x000A;-----------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30. (SBU) Interior Minister since 2006, Alfredo Perez&#x000A;Rubalcaba is Zapatero's main advisor on terrorism issues. He&#x000A;is also one of the six members of Zapatero's core team (the&#x000A;others are de la Vega, Solbes, Deputy Chief of Cabinet&#x000A;Jose-Enrique Serrano, Cabinet Aide Vidal Zapatero (a cousin),&#x000A;and PSOE campaign manager, Jose "Pepe" Blanco) that meets&#x000A;once a week to formulate policy. Rubalcaba is regarded as a&#x000A;skilled negotiator and parliamentarian. Beside the fight&#x000A;against ETA and Islamic terrorism, his other challenges will&#x000A;include perceptions that common crime is on the rise,&#x000A;continuing efforts to reduce traffic deaths and long-standing&#x000A;wage and work status disputes in the police forces.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31. (SBU) One of Rubalcaba's toughest jobs will continue to&#x000A;be overcoming the historic rivalry between Spain's principal&#x000A;police forces, the Civil Guard and National Police, both of&#x000A;which fall under his direction. Rubalcaba reportedly tried&#x000A;but failed to bring the Spanish intelligence service DNI&#x000A;under his control (it is currently in the MOD).&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32. (SBU) Rubalcaba has played influential roles in PSOE&#x000A;internal operations and he directed electoral strategy for&#x000A;the PSOE's 2004 campaign. After the March 2004 elections,&#x000A;Rubalcaba was appointed PSOE's overall spokesman in Congress&#x000A;and maintained good personal rapport with his PP-counterpart&#x000A;Eduardo Zaplana despite many harsh political confrontations,&#x000A;a testament to his equanimity. Within the PSOE party&#x000A;structure, Rubalcaba is not close to Zapatero insider Pepe&#x000A;Blanco, and their relations can be tense. Some say Rubalcaba&#x000A;is the "Lord of the Government," and Blanco is the "Lord of&#x000A;the Party."&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33. (SBU) During the Aznar administration, Rubalcaba&#x000A;served as PSOE's Media Relations Secretary and was lead&#x000A;negotiator on the bipartisan anti-terrorist pact and the&#x000A;political parties law. He served as Education Minister from&#x000A;1992 to 1993 after several years in key advisory roles. In&#x000A;1993 he was promoted to Minister of the Presidency and of&#x000A;Relations with the Parliament, in addition to being&#x000A;Government Spokesman (a period he describes as "the three&#x000A;worst years of my life."&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34. (U) A member of Congress since 1993, Rubalcaba is&#x000A;reputed to have a good sense of humor. The media also notes&#x000A;Rubalcaba's strong work ethic, willingness to undertake&#x000A;additional assignments, and negotiation skills. According to&#x000A;the press, his friends praise his ability to resolve&#x000A;contentious issues and calm excited colleagues. His enemies&#x000A;describe Rubalcaba as manipulative and quick to exploit the&#x000A;weaknesses of others.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35. (U) Rubalcaba was born in Solares (Santander) in 1951.&#x000A;He joined the Madrid Socialist Federation in 1974 and became&#x000A;interested in politics near the end of the Franco regime.&#x000A;With his Doctorate in Chemistry from the Complutense&#x000A;University of Madrid, he taught Organic Chemistry there, as&#x000A;well as at the University of Contanza (Germany), and the&#x000A;University of Montpellier (France).&#x000A;&#x000A;--------------------------------&#x000A;Elena Salgado&#x000A;Ministry of Public Administration&#x000A;--------------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36. (U) Appointed Minister of Public Administration on July&#x000A;6, 2007, Elena Salgado brings breadth and depth of experience&#x000A;to her portfolio. Enjoying a reputation for sound fiscal&#x000A;management, in this legislature she will have to deal with&#x000A;the extremely complicated local corporation funding law,&#x000A;facilitating an accord between the PSOE-led government and&#x000A;the PP-led opposition, and then negotiating its&#x000A;implementation between the national government, the&#x000A;autonomous communities, and the local governments. Salgado&#x000A;will also be charged with implementing Zapatero's announced&#x000A;reform of State Administration.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37. (U) Salgado served as Health Minister of Health from&#x000A;2004 to 2007, tasked with managing federal health and&#x000A;&#x000A;MADRID 00000552 006.2 OF 011&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;pharmaceutical spending and expanding public health services.&#x000A;Salgado's efforts were deemed responsible for the unanimous&#x000A;passage of the smoking ban in workplaces and public spaces in&#x000A;<a id='par2005' href='#par2005'>¶</a>2005. During her stint at the Health Ministry, the press&#x000A;termed Salgado, "Minister Anti", referring to her positions&#x000A;against alcohol, smoking, and obesity. The Spanish&#x000A;Government presented Salgado as a candidate for the World&#x000A;Health Organization Presidency in September 2006, but she was&#x000A;not elected.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par38' href='#par38'>¶</a>38. (U) Elena Salgado served as Secretary General for&#x000A;Communications in the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and&#x000A;Environment with Minister Jose Borrell in President Felipe&#x000A;Gonzalez's administration. She helped transform the National&#x000A;Postal Office and participated in the telecommunications&#x000A;liberalization process. She served as a member of the Board&#x000A;of Telefonica Hispasat, Retevision and Correos. She also&#x000A;approved the Sogecable (Prisa) and Telefonica merger to&#x000A;create Cablevision, although the proposal was rejected by the&#x000A;European Commission, leading to Cablevision's eventual&#x000A;dissolution.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par39' href='#par39'>¶</a>39. (U) Her other public service credentials include&#x000A;Director General for Personnel Costs and Public Pensions in&#x000A;the Economy Ministry and Finance and Director of Studies in&#x000A;the Small and Medium Business Institute in the Industry&#x000A;Ministry. In 1996 she was President of the Lyric Theatre&#x000A;Foundation that manages the Royal Opera House. While she is&#x000A;not a PSOE member, Salgado does have close ties with party&#x000A;loyalists including Interior Minister Rubalcaba and her&#x000A;former boss Jose Borrell.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par40' href='#par40'>¶</a>40. (U) In the private sector, Salgado served in advisory&#x000A;capacities with Arthur Andersen (1999-2000), Lenci Consulting&#x000A;SL (1997-2000), and the Social Council of the Universidad&#x000A;Politecnica (1999-2002). In 2002, Salgado was appointed CEO&#x000A;of Vallehermoso Telecom, but the press reported she was let&#x000A;go because she was too intransigent. In September 2003,&#x000A;Salgado was named President of 11811 Nueva Informacion&#x000A;Telefonica, the Spanish branch of the German multinational&#x000A;Telegate AG.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par41' href='#par41'>¶</a>41. (U) Elena Salgado was born in Orense in 1949. She has&#x000A;a degree in industrial engineering with a specialization in&#x000A;Energy from the Universidad Politecnica, and another in&#x000A;economics from the Complutense University. Most of her&#x000A;professional life has been in the telecommunications world.&#x000A;She speaks English and French.&#x000A;&#x000A;-------------------------------------&#x000A;Magdalena Alvarez Arza&#x000A;Minister of Public Works (Fomento - also translated as&#x000A;Development)&#x000A;--------------------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par42' href='#par42'>¶</a>42. (SBU) Returning for her second cabinet term, Minister&#x000A;Alvarez is responsible for the government's 15-year,&#x000A;250-billion euro plan to expand the high-speed rail (AVE) and&#x000A;road networks, which the GOS says will give Spain more&#x000A;kilometers of high speed rail lines than any other country.&#x000A;She was widely criticized in 2007 after prolonged delays in&#x000A;the construction of the AVE line between Madrid and&#x000A;Barcelona, with the deaths of construction workers and&#x000A;construction accidents that interrupted service on several of&#x000A;Barcelona's commuter lines for six weeks. In November 2007,&#x000A;the Catalan legislature approved a motion calling for her&#x000A;resignation, and the national Senate approved such a motion&#x000A;in December. A similar motion in the national Congress (the&#x000A;more influential lower house) failed by only three votes in&#x000A;November. In addition to difficult relations with Catalonia,&#x000A;she also has had a tense relationship with Madrid Autonomous&#x000A;Community President Esperanza Aguirre. Many observers had&#x000A;thought it likely that Zapatero would replace Alvarez after&#x000A;the election. While she is known for her loyalty to&#x000A;Zapatero, some local press posit that the powerful President&#x000A;of Andalucia, Manuel Chaves, played a role in maintaining&#x000A;Alvarez's cabinet position. Wags claim Chaves recommended&#x000A;her to Zapatero years ago to get her out of Andalucia and he&#x000A;insisted Zapatero keep her in the cabinet (and in Madrid) in&#x000A;his second term. The eventual opening of the&#x000A;Madrid-Barcelona line just before the election, along with&#x000A;the opening in late 2007 of AVE lines to Malaga and&#x000A;Valladolid may have reduced the pressure on Alvarez.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par43' href='#par43'>¶</a>43. (SBU) Alvarez, who joined the PSOE in 1997, served as a&#x000A;key advisor as Zapatero prepared his 2004 election bid. She&#x000A;has worked as a university economics lecturer and at&#x000A;positions in the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the&#x000A;&#x000A;MADRID 00000552 007.2 OF 011&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;state agency of tax administration. She was councilor for&#x000A;economy and finance in the Andalucia Autonomous Community&#x000A;government from 1994 to 2004, developing a reputation for&#x000A;expertise on regional finance issues. According to the&#x000A;press, her husband, Juan Manuel Gonzalez-Aurioles, is&#x000A;director general of Emgrisa, a business related to the&#x000A;uranium enrichment and nuclear energy sector. Alvarez was&#x000A;born in San Fernando, Cadiz in 1952. She has an&#x000A;undergraduate degree and a PhD. in economic and business&#x000A;sciences, the former from the Complutense University of&#x000A;Madrid and the latter from the University of Malaga. She&#x000A;understands and speaks some English but prefers not to use it&#x000A;in meetings.&#x000A;&#x000A;------------------------------------&#x000A;Elena Espinosa&#x000A;Minister of Environment, Rural, and Maritime Issues (merger&#x000A;of Environment and Agriculture)&#x000A;-------------------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par44' href='#par44'>¶</a>44. (SBU) Elena Espinosa was named Minister of Agriculture,&#x000A;Fisheries and Food when Zapatero took office in 2004. Most&#x000A;recently, she was voted a deputy in the National Congress in&#x000A;the 2008 election.&#x000A;At the start of Zapatero's second administration, Espinosa's&#x000A;ministry absorbs the functions of the former Environment&#x000A;ministry. The Agriculture Ministry, under her leadership,&#x000A;had been generally supportive of agricultural biotechnology,&#x000A;while the former Environment Ministry had generally opposed&#x000A;it. Espinosa takes on responsibility for Spain's drought and&#x000A;related water issues. She also gains responsibility for&#x000A;climate change, which has been elevated to having a separate&#x000A;secretary of state (deputy minister). She may have a role in&#x000A;deciding next steps as Spain's nuclear power plants approach&#x000A;the end of their scheduled operation; Zapatero has said that&#x000A;Spain will close the plants, but in recent weeks he has&#x000A;appeared to leave the door open for reconsideration.&#x000A;Espinosa has not taken anti-nuclear positions.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par45' href='#par45'>¶</a>45. (U) Espinosa's public service began in 1985 in Vigo,&#x000A;Galicia under Felipe Gonzalez's PSOE-led government. From&#x000A;1988 through 1996, Espinosa was president of the Port&#x000A;Authority of Vigo, an active port that is the home to Spain's&#x000A;largest fishing fleet. Espinosa introduced port reforms&#x000A;that set her against the local PSOE party leadership. In&#x000A;1996, Espinosa served as labor advisor at the Galician&#x000A;Institute of Technical Medicine. She returned to the private&#x000A;sector and was the number two at the Rodman shipbuilding&#x000A;group from 1998 to 2004.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par45' href='#par45'>¶</a>45.

(U) A new face in the Spanish cabinet, as head of a&#x000A;newly created Ministry, Bibiana Aido's challenges include&#x000A;establishing the new equality law, developing the dependent's&#x000A;law, and expanding social coverage for legal immigrants. The&#x000A;new ministry will incorporate the government's Youth&#x000A;Institute and the Women's Institute along with existing&#x000A;programs geared at ending violence, increasing the presence&#x000A;of women in the public life and the private sector workplace.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par48' href='#par48'>¶</a>48.

A PSOE&#x000A;card holder since 1995, she is Secretary of Equality of the&#x000A;PSOE's Executive Commission of Cadiz. From February 2003 to&#x000A;July 2006 Aido served in the Andalucian regional Ministry of&#x000A;Culture and from July 2006 to March 2008 she directed the&#x000A;Andalucian Agency for the Development of Flamenco. According&#x000A;to the media, Andalucian President Manuel Chaves considers&#x000A;Aido as one of his potential successors. For that reason,&#x000A;Chaves supported her candidacy for a national-level political&#x000A;position that would bring her additional public recognition.&#x000A;Interior Minister Rubalcaba is also one of her mentors.&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par49' href='#par49'>¶</a>49.

This&#x000A;Ministry now manages social policy that was previously&#x000A;directed in the former Labor Ministry (now Labor and&#x000A;Immigration Ministry). Cabrera will have to implement the&#x000A;Law of Dependence and Law against Gender Violence passed&#x000A;during the last legislature in coordination with her&#x000A;colleague, Equality Minister Aido. The Ministry lost its&#x000A;control over Spanish universities, which are now transferred&#x000A;to the newly created Ministry of Science and Innovation.&#x000A;&#x000A;In addition to her work reorganizing the Ministry's scope of&#x000A;work, Cabrera faces many of the same challenges including&#x000A;implementing the controversial "Citizens Education&#x000A;Curriculum," that is viewed by the opposition party as an&#x000A;"indoctrination" program and that has been contested in&#x000A;Courts by parents and parent associations. Cabrera will&#x000A;also manage efforts to minimize the Catholic Church's&#x000A;unhappiness for taking "catholic religion" out of the&#x000A;national curriculum.&#x000A;&#x000A;A long-time Zapatero confident, Cabrera helped write the PSOE&#x000A;2000 electoral program. She attended Colegio Estudio of&#x000A;Madrid. She received a doctorate in 1977. She became a&#x000A;university professor in 1996 and currently teaches at the&#x000A;University of Complutense.

He left&#x000A;that position when he accepted Zapatero's request to be the&#x000A;PSOE's candidate for mayor of Madrid in the 2007 election.&#x000A;He was not expected to defeat the popular PP incumbent&#x000A;Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, and his clear defeat does not seem to&#x000A;have damaged his influence over policy within the PSOE. In&#x000A;his Presidency position, Sebastian clashed with Second Vice&#x000A;President and Finance and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes,&#x000A;generally taking more interventionist positions than Solbes.&#x000A;Sebastian was closely involved in the GOS' efforts to prevent&#x000A;the German electric utility E.ON from purchasing Spanish&#x000A;utility Endesa, and he was reported to have helped broker the&#x000A;eventually successful bid by the Italian company Enel and&#x000A;Spain's Acciona to acquire Endesa. In the weeks after the&#x000A;March 9 election, he has been reported to be encouraging&#x000A;&#x000A;MADRID 00000552 009.2 OF 011&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;deals among Spain's energy companies that would prevent&#x000A;France's EDF from taking over Spain's Iberdrola. As Minister&#x000A;of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce, he has formal&#x000A;responsibility for energy regulation, and he has named a&#x000A;former subordinate at the Economic Office of the President,&#x000A;Pedro Marin, to be Secretary General of Energy. (Solbes had&#x000A;reportedly sought to gain responsibility for energy in this&#x000A;government.) Two of the new ministers, Science and&#x000A;Innovation Minister Cristina Garmendia and Housing Minister&#x000A;Beatriz Corredor, are said to be Sebastian allies.&#x000A;&#x000A;Sebastian was born on May 13, 1957. He has a degree in&#x000A;Economic and Business Sciences from Madrid's Complutense&#x000A;University and a PhD. in economics from the University of&#x000A;Minnesota. His doctoral studies were partially financed by a&#x000A;Fulbright Scholarship. He has worked in the planning office&#x000A;of the Economy and Finance Ministry and the Central Bank's&#x000A;economic studies office. In the private sector, he was&#x000A;Director of Studies (chief economist) for Banco Bilbao&#x000A;Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) and its predecessor. He is viewed&#x000A;as a competent and pragmatic economist who is also a PSOE&#x000A;partisan and is likely to take political considerations into&#x000A;account in setting policy. He speaks English and has&#x000A;emphasized the importance of encouraging Spaniards to learn&#x000A;English.&#x000A;&#x000A;-----------------------------------------&#x000A;Cristina Garmendia Mendizabal (new)&#x000A;Minister of Science and Innovation (new Ministry)&#x000A;-----------------------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;Cristina Garmendia is a biotechnology business executive who&#x000A;is connected to new Minister of Industry, Tourism, and&#x000A;Commerce Miguel Sebastian.

Sebastian is reported to&#x000A;have recommended her selection to President Zapatero. Some&#x000A;political analysts have speculated that her selection is also&#x000A;a reward for the excellent results the PSOE obtained in the&#x000A;Basque Country in the 2008 elections; Zapatero's previous&#x000A;Cabinet did not include any Basque ministers. According to&#x000A;press reports, she is not a member of the PSOE. Garmendia's&#x000A;ministry is a new one that has taken portfolios from several&#x000A;other ministries, including the Ministries of Health and&#x000A;Education. Press reports have described its creation as a&#x000A;sign of Zapatero's emphasis on encouraging research and&#x000A;development in order to boost Spain's productivity over the&#x000A;long term and contribute to economic growth. After being&#x000A;named Minister, Garmendia told a reporter that her ministry&#x000A;would work with the business sector, universities, and the&#x000A;public sector to take full advantage of scientific knowledge.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Garmendia is from San Sebastian in the Basque Country.

In 2000 she was a co-founder of the&#x000A;medical biotechnology company Genetrix, the first company&#x000A;hat emerged from research work conducted by Spain's National&#x000A;Center for Biotechnology. She was president and CEO of&#x000A;Genetrix from 2000 to 2008. She has been president of&#x000A;several other biotechnology companies and is president of the&#x000A;board of the Inbiomed Foundation, which has the first bank of&#x000A;adult stem cells in Spain. From 2005 to 2008, she was&#x000A;president of the Association of Biotechnological Enterprises&#x000A;(ASEBIO).

She is married with&#x000A;four children. She has traveled to the U.S. on business&#x000A;frequently and speaks English.&#x000A;&#x000A;-----------------------------&#x000A;Beatriz Corredor (new)&#x000A;&#x000A;MADRID 00000552 010.2 OF 011&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Minister of Housing&#x000A;-----------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;Beatriz Corredor replaces now-Defense Minister Carme Chacon&#x000A;as Housing Minister. Corredor is reported to be a political&#x000A;ally of new Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce&#x000A;Miguel Sebastian. She obtained a law degree from the&#x000A;Autonomous University of Madrid in 1991 and passed the&#x000A;examinations to become a member of the Body of Registrars at&#x000A;a relatively young age in 1993. She has held office at land&#x000A;registries in Valencia de Alcantara, Caceres; Campillos,&#x000A;Malaga; and Lillo, Toledo. She has lectured on law at the&#x000A;Universities of Castile-La Mancha and Ciudad Real and has&#x000A;spoken at seminars on issues such as mortgage clauses and&#x000A;secondary mortgage markets. She was the first woman board&#x000A;member for the examination to become a Registrar. She joined&#x000A;the PSOE in 2003 and became the Madrid City Councilor for&#x000A;Housing in September 2007.&#x000A;&#x000A;As Housing Minister, Corredor will have to address the&#x000A;aftereffects of Spain's multi-year housing boom and its&#x000A;sudden end in 2007; both the high prices that have made&#x000A;housing expensive for many Spaniards and the rapid decline in&#x000A;housing construction. She will seek to implement efforts&#x000A;begun by Chacon -- who was only Minister for nine months --&#x000A;to make housing more affordable by providing income-tested&#x000A;subsidies to young renters by making it easier for property&#x000A;owners to evict tenants for nonpayment of rent. Corredor&#x000A;also will seek to increase the amount of housing built with&#x000A;public subsidies, which may be a way to help the many real&#x000A;estate and construction companies that are in financial&#x000A;difficulties.&#x000A;&#x000A;Corredor was born in Madrid in July 1968. She is married and&#x000A;has three daughters. She speaks and understands basic&#x000A;English but needs an interpreter for nearly all purposes.&#x000A;&#x000A;------------------------&#x000A;Bernat Soria Escoms&#x000A;Minister of Health and Consumption&#x000A;--------------------------&#x000A;&#x000A;Minister of Health since July 2007, Soria emphasized the&#x000A;importance of increasing Spanish research and development in&#x000A;his first term. Press reports indicate that in Zapatero's&#x000A;second administration, this aspect of his ministry's&#x000A;portfolio has been shifted to the new Ministry of Innovation&#x000A;and Technology.&#x000A;&#x000A;Soria is a medical doctor (University of Valencia) and a&#x000A;leading expert on stem cells. He has worked extensively in&#x000A;the U.S. and has a very positive image of the U.S. He&#x000A;coordinated the European Embryonic Stem Cell Network, taught&#x000A;physiology at Pablo de Olvide University in Alicante, and&#x000A;directed the Andalucian Center of Molecular Biology and&#x000A;Regenerative Medicine in Seville.

He also has worked in laboratories&#x000A;in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland, as well as the&#x000A;U.S. He has received many professional awards and presided&#x000A;over several professional societies.
