Russell. Reason 1.4 ( &#x000A;b, d) &#x000A;&#x000A;Summary &#x000A;------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1. (C) Weddings are elaborate in Dagestan, the largest &#x000A;autonomy in the North Caucasus. On August 22 we attended a &#x000A;wedding in Makhachkala, Dagestan’s capital: Duma member and &#x000A;Dagestan Oil Company chief Gadzhi Makhachev’s son married a &#x000A;classmate. The lavish display and heavy drinking concealed &#x000A;the deadly serious North Caucasus politics of land, &#x000A;ethnicity, clan, and alliance. The guest list spanned the &#x000A;Caucasus power structure -- guest starring Chechen leader &#x000A;Ramzan Kadyrov -- and underlined just how personal the &#x000A;region’s politics can be. End Summary. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2. (C) Dagestani weddings are serious business: a forum for &#x000A;showing respect, fealty and alliance among families; the &#x000A;bride and groom themselves are little more than showpieces. &#x000A;Weddings take place in discrete parts over three days. On &#x000A;the first day the groom’s family and the bride’s family &#x000A;simultaneously hold separate receptions. During the &#x000A;receptions the groom leads a delegation to the bride’s &#x000A;reception and escorts her back to his own reception, at which &#x000A;point she formally becomes a member of the groom’s family, &#x000A;forsaking her old family and clan. The next day, the groom’s &#x000A;parents hold another reception, this time for the bride’s &#x000A;family and friends, who can “inspect” the family they have &#x000A;given their daughter to. On the third day, the bride’s &#x000A;family holds a reception for the groom’s parents and family. &#x000A;&#x000A;Father of the Groom &#x000A;------------------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3. (C) On August 22, Gadzhi Makhachev married off his 19 &#x000A;year-old son Dalgat to Aida Sharipova. The wedding in &#x000A;Makhachkala, which we attended, was a microcosm of the social &#x000A;and political relations of the North Caucasus, beginning with &#x000A;Gadzhi’s own biography. Gadzhi started off as an Avar clan &#x000A;leader. Enver Kisriyev, the leading scholar of Dagestani &#x000A;society, told us that as Soviet power receded from Dagestan &#x000A;in the late 1980s, the complex society fell back to its &#x000A;pre-Russian structure. The basic structural unit is the &#x000A;monoethnic “jamaat,” in this usage best translated as &#x000A;”canton” or “commune.” The ethnic groups themselves are a &#x000A;Russian construct: faced with hundreds of jamaats, the 19th &#x000A;century Russian conquerors lumped cantons speaking related &#x000A;dialects together and called them “Avar,” “Dargin,” etc. to &#x000A;reduce the number of “nationalities” in Dagestan to 38. Ever &#x000A;since then, jamaats within each ethnic group have been &#x000A;competing with one another to lead the ethnic group. This &#x000A;competition is especially marked among the Avars, the largest &#x000A;nationality in Dagestan. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4. (C) As Russian power faded, each canton fielded a militia &#x000A;to defend its people both in the mountains and the capital &#x000A;Makhachkala. Gadzhi became the leader from his home canton &#x000A;of Burtunay, in Kazbek Rayon. He later asserted pan-Avar &#x000A;ambitions, founding the Imam Shamil Popular Front -- named &#x000A;after the great Avar leader of mountaineer resistance to the &#x000A;Russians -- to promote the interests of the Avars and of &#x000A;Burtunay’s role within the ethnic group. Among his exploits &#x000A;was a role in the military defense of Dagestan against the &#x000A;1999 invasion from Chechnya by Shamil Basayev and al-Khattab, &#x000A;and his political defense of Avar villages under pressure in &#x000A;Chechnya, Georgia and Azerbaijan. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5. (C) Gadzhi has cashed in the social capital he made from &#x000A;nationalism, translating it into financial and political &#x000A;capital -- as head of Dagestan’s state oil company and as the &#x000A;single-mandate representative for Makhachkala in Russia’s &#x000A;State Duma. His dealings in the oil business -- including &#x000A;close cooperation with U.S. firms -- have left him well off &#x000A;enough to afford luxurious houses in Makhachkala, Kaspiysk, &#x000A;Moscow, Paris and San Diego; and a large collection of luxury &#x000A;automobiles, including the Rolls Royce Silver Phantom in &#x000A;which Dalgat fetched Aida from her parents’ reception. &#x000A;(Gadzhi gave us a lift in the Rolls once in Moscow, but the &#x000A;legroom was somewhat constricted by the presence of a &#x000A;Kalashnikov carbine at our feet. Gadzhi has survived &#x000A;numerous assassination attempts, as have most of the &#x000A;still-living leaders of Dagestan. In Dagestan he always &#x000A;travels in an armored BMW with one, sometimes two follow cars &#x000A;full of uniformed armed guards.) &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6. (C) Gadzhi has gone beyond his Avar base, pursuing a &#x000A;multi-ethnic cadre policy to develop a network of loyalists. &#x000A;He has sent Dagestani youths, including his sons, to a &#x000A;military type high school near San Diego (we met one &#x000A;graduate, a Jewish boy from Derbent now studying at San Diego &#x000A;state. He has no plans to enter the Russian military). &#x000A;&#x000A;MOSCOW 00009533 002 OF 005 &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Gadzhi’s multi-ethnic reach illustrates what the editor of &#x000A;the Dagestani paper “Chernovik” told us: that in the last &#x000A;few years the development of inter-ethnic business clans has &#x000A;eroded traditional jamaat loyalties. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7. (C) But the Avar symbolism is still strong. Gadzhi’s &#x000A;brother, an artist from St. Petersburg, ordered as a wedding &#x000A;gift a life-sized statue of Imam Shamil. Shamil is the &#x000A;iconic national symbol, despite his stern and inflexible &#x000A;character (portrayed in Tolstoy’s “Hadji-Murat” as the &#x000A;mountaineers’ tyrannical counterpart to the absolutist Tsar). &#x000A;Connection with Shamil makes for nobility among Avars today. &#x000A;Gadzhi often mentions that he is a descendant on his &#x000A;mother’s side of Gair-Bek, one of Shamil’s deputies. &#x000A;&#x000A;The Day Before &#x000A;-------------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8. (C) Gadzhi’s Kaspiysk summer house is an enormous &#x000A;structure on the shore of the Caspian, essentially a huge &#x000A;circular reception room -- much like a large restaurant -- &#x000A;attached to a 40-meter high green airport tower on columns, &#x000A;accessible only by elevator, with a couple of bedrooms, a &#x000A;reception room, and a grotto whose glass floor was the roof &#x000A;of a huge fish tank. The heavily guarded compound also &#x000A;boasts a second house, outbuildings, a tennis court, and two &#x000A;piers out into the Caspian, one rigged with block and tackle &#x000A;for launching jet skis. The house filled up with visitors &#x000A;from all over the Caucasus during the afternoon of August 21. &#x000A;The Chair of Ingushetia’s parliament drove in with two &#x000A;colleagues; visitors from Moscow included politicians, &#x000A;businessmen and an Avar football coach. Many of the visitors &#x000A;grew up with Gadzhi in Khasavyurt, including an Ingush &#x000A;Olympic wrestler named Vakha who seemed to be perpetually &#x000A;tipsy. Another group of Gadzhi’s boyhood friends from &#x000A;Khasavyurt was led by a man who looked like Shamil Basayev on &#x000A;his day off -- flip-flops, t-shirt, baseball cap, beard -- &#x000A;but turned out to be the chief rabbi of Stavropol Kray. He &#x000A;told us he has 12,000 co-religionists in the province, 8,000 &#x000A;of them in its capital, Pyatigorsk. 70 percent are, like &#x000A;him, Persian-speaking Mountain Jews; the rest are a mixture &#x000A;of Europeans, Georgians and Bukharans. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9. (C) Also present was XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. He was reserved at the time, but in a &#x000A;follow-up conversation in Moscow on August 29 (please &#x000A;protect) he complained that Chechnya, lacking experts to &#x000A;develop programs for economic recovery, is simply demanding &#x000A;and disposing of cash from the central government. When we &#x000A;pressed him on disappearances, he admitted some took place, &#x000A;but claimed that often parents alleged their children had &#x000A;been abducted when in fact their sons had run off to join the &#x000A;fighters or -- in a case the week before -- they had murdered &#x000A;their daughter in an honor killing. We mentioned the &#x000A;abduction of a widow of Basayev, allegedly to gain access to &#x000A;his money. XXXXXX said he had not heard of the case, but &#x000A;knew that Basayev had had no interest in wealth; he may have &#x000A;been a religious fanatic, but he was a “normal” person. The &#x000A;fighters who remain are not a serious military force, in XXXXX view, and many would surrender under the proper &#x000A;terms and immunities. He himself is arranging the immunity &#x000A;of a senior official of the Maskhadov era, whose name he &#x000A;would not reveal. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10. (C) During lunch, Gadzhi took a congratulatory call from &#x000A;Dagestan’s president, Mukhu Aliyev. Gadzhi told Aliyev how &#x000A;honored he would be if Aliyev could drop in at the wedding &#x000A;reception. There was a degree of tension in the &#x000A;conversation, which was between two figures each implicitly &#x000A;claiming the mantle of leadership of the Avars. In the &#x000A;event, Aliyev snubbed Gadzhi and did not show up for the &#x000A;wedding, though the rest of Dagestan’s political leadership &#x000A;did. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11. (C) Though Gadzhi’s house was not the venue for the main &#x000A;wedding reception, he ensured that all his guests were &#x000A;constantly plied with food and drink. The cooks seemed to &#x000A;keep whole sheep and whole cows boiling in a cauldron &#x000A;somewhere day and night, dumping disjointed fragments of the &#x000A;carcass on the tables whenever someone entered the room. &#x000A;Gadzhi’s two chefs kept a wide variety of unusual dishes in &#x000A;circulation (in addition to the omnipresent boiled meat and &#x000A;fatty bouillon). The alcohol consumption before, during and &#x000A;after this Muslim wedding was stupendous. Amidst an alcohol &#x000A;shortage, Gadzhi had flown in from the Urals thousands of &#x000A;bottles of Beluga Export vodka (“Best consumed with caviar”). &#x000A;There was also entertainment, beginning even that day, with &#x000A;the big-name performers appearing both at the wedding hall &#x000A;and at Gadzhi’s summer house. Gadzhi’s main act, a &#x000A;Syrian-born singer named Avraam Russo, could not make it &#x000A;because he was shot a few days before the wedding, but there &#x000A;&#x000A;MOSCOW 00009533 003 OF 005 &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;was a “gypsy” troupe from St. Petersburg, a couple of Azeri &#x000A;pop stars, and from Moscow, Benya the Accordion King with his &#x000A;family of singers. A host of local bands, singing in Avar &#x000A;and Dargin, rounded out the entertainment, which was constant &#x000A;and extremely amplified. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10. (C) The main activity of the day was eating and drinking &#x000A;-- starting from 4 p.m., about eight hours worth, all told -- &#x000A;punctuated, when all were laden with food and sodden with &#x000A;drink, with a bout of jet skiing in the Caspian. After &#x000A;dinner, though, the first band started an informal &#x000A;performance -- drums, accordion and clarinet playing the &#x000A;lezginka, the universal dance of the Caucasus. To the &#x000A;uninitiated Westerner, the music sounds like an &#x000A;undifferentiated wall of sound. This was a signal for &#x000A;dancing: one by one, each of the dramatically paunchy men &#x000A;(there were no women present) would enter the arena and &#x000A;exhibit his personal lezginka for the limit of his duration, &#x000A;usually 30 seconds to a minute. Each ethnic group’s lezginka &#x000A;was different -- the Dagestani lezginka the most energetic, &#x000A;the Chechen the most aggressive and belligerent, and the &#x000A;Ingush smoother. &#x000A;&#x000A;Wedding Day 1 &#x000A;------------- &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11. (C) An hour before the wedding reception was set to begin &#x000A;the “Marrakech” reception hall was full of guests -- men &#x000A;taking the air outside and women already filling a number of &#x000A;the tables inside, older ones with headscarves chaperoning &#x000A;dozens of teenaged girls. A Dagestani parliamentarian &#x000A;explained that weddings are a principal venue for teenagers &#x000A;-- and more importantly their parents -- to get a look at one &#x000A;another with a view to future matches. Security was tight -- &#x000A;police presence on the ground plus police snipers positioned &#x000A;on the roof of an overlooking apartment block. Gadzhi even &#x000A;assigned one of his guards as our personal bodyguard inside &#x000A;the reception. The manager told Gadzhi there were seats for &#x000A;over a thousand guests at a time. At the height of the &#x000A;reception, it was standing room only. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12. (C) At precisely two p.m. the male guests started filing &#x000A;in. They varied from pols and oligarchs of all sorts -- the &#x000A;slick to the Jurassic; wizened brown peasants from Burtunay; &#x000A;and Dagestan’s sports and cultural celebrities XXXXXXX presided over a political table in the smaller of &#x000A;the two halls (the music was in the other) along with Vakha &#x000A;the drunken wrestler, the Ingush parliamentarians, a member &#x000A;of the Federation Council who is also a nanophysicist and has &#x000A;lectured in Silicon Valley, and Gadzhi’s cousin Ismail &#x000A;Alibekov, a submariner first rank naval captain now serving &#x000A;at the General Staff in Moscow. The Dagestani milieu appears &#x000A;to be one in which the highly educated and the gun-toting can &#x000A;mix easily -- often in the same person. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13. (C) After a couple of hours Dalgat’s convoy returned with &#x000A;Aida, horns honking. Dalgat and Aida got out of the Rolls &#x000A;and were serenaded into the hall, and into the Makhachev &#x000A;family, by a boys’ chorus lining both sides of the red &#x000A;carpet, dressed in costumes aping medieval Dagestani armor &#x000A;with little shields and swords. The couple’s entry was the &#x000A;signal for the emcee to roll into high gear, and after a few &#x000A;toasts the Piter “gypsies” began their performance. (The &#x000A;next day one of Gadzhi’s houseguests sneered, “Some gypsies! &#x000A;The bandleader was certainly Jewish, and the rest of them &#x000A;were blonde.” There was some truth to this, but at least the &#x000A;two dancing girls appeared to be Roma.) &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14. (C) As the bands played, the marriageable girls came out &#x000A;to dance the lezginka in what looked like a slowly revolving &#x000A;conga line while the boys sat together at tables staring &#x000A;intently. The boys were all in white shirts and black &#x000A;slacks, while the girls wore a wide variety of multicolored &#x000A;but fashionable cocktail dresses. Every so often someone &#x000A;would shower the dancers with money -- there were some &#x000A;thousand ruble notes but the currency of choice was the U.S. &#x000A;hundred dollar bill. The floor was covered with them; young &#x000A;children would scoop the money up to distribute among the &#x000A;dancers. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15. (C) Gadzhi was locked into his role as host. He greeted &#x000A;every guest personally as they entered the hall -- failure to &#x000A;do so would cause great insult -- and later moved constantly &#x000A;from table to table drinking toasts with everyone. The 120 &#x000A;toasts he estimated he drank would have killed anyone, &#x000A;hardened drinker or not, but Gadzhi had his Afghan waiter &#x000A;Khan following him around to pour his drinks from a special &#x000A;vodka bottle containing water. Still, he was much the worse &#x000A;for wear by evening’s end. At one point we caught up with &#x000A;him dancing with two scantily clad Russian women who looked &#x000A;far from home. One, it turned out was a Moscow poet (later &#x000A;she recited an incomprehensible poem in Gadzhi’s honor) who &#x000A;&#x000A;MOSCOW 00009533 004 OF 005 &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;was in town with a film director to write the screenplay for &#x000A;a film immortalizing Gadzhi’s defense of Dagestan against &#x000A;Shamil Basayev. By 6 p.m. most of the houseguests had &#x000A;returned to Gadzhi’s seaside home for more swimming and more &#x000A;jet-skiing-under-the-influence. But by 8 the summer house’s &#x000A;restaurant was full once more, the food and drink were &#x000A;flowing, the name performers were giving acoustic renditions &#x000A;of the songs they had sung at the reception, and some &#x000A;stupendously fat guests were displaying their lezginkas for &#x000A;the benefit of the two visiting Russian women, who had &#x000A;wandered over from the reception. &#x000A;&#x000A;The Wedding -- Day 2: Enter The Man &#x000A;------------------------------------ &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16. (C) The next day’s reception at the Marrakech was &#x000A;Gadzhi’s tribute to Aida’s family, after which we all &#x000A;returned to a dinner at Gadzhi’s summer home. Most of the &#x000A;tables were set with the usual dishes plus whole roast &#x000A;sturgeons and sheep. But at 8:00 p.m. the compound was &#x000A;invaded by dozens of heavily armed mujahedin for the grand &#x000A;entrance of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, dressed in jeans &#x000A;and a t-shirt, looking shorter and less muscular than in his &#x000A;photos, and with a somewhat cock-eyed expression on his face. &#x000A;After greetings from Gadzhi, Ramzan and about 20 of his &#x000A;retinue sat around the tables eating and listening to Benya &#x000A;the Accordion King. Gadzhi then announced a fireworks &#x000A;display in honor of the birthday of Ramzan’s late father, &#x000A;Ahmat-Hadji Kadyrov. The fireworks started with a bang that &#x000A;made both Gadzhi and Ramzan flinch. Gadzhi had from the &#x000A;beginning requested that none of his guests, most of whom &#x000A;carried sidearms, fire their weapons in celebration. &#x000A;Throughout the wedding they complied, not even joining in the &#x000A;magnificent fireworks display. &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17. (C) After the fireworks, the musicians struck up the &#x000A;lezginka in the courtyard and a group of two girls and three &#x000A;boys -- one no more than six years old -- performed gymnastic &#x000A;versions of the dance. First Gadzhi joined them and then &#x000A;Ramzan, who danced clumsily with his gold-plated automatic &#x000A;stuck down in the back of his jeans (a houseguest later &#x000A;pointed out that the gold housing eliminated any practical &#x000A;use of the gun, but smirked that Ramzan probably couldn’t &#x000A;fire it anyway). Both Gadzhi and Ramzan showered the dancing &#x000A;children with hundred dollar bills; the dancers probably &#x000A;picked upwards of USD 5000 off the cobblestones. Gadzhi told &#x000A;us later that Ramzan had brought the happy couple “a five &#x000A;kilo lump of gold” as his wedding present. After the dancing &#x000A;and a quick tour of the premises, Ramzan and his army drove &#x000A;off back to Chechnya. We asked why Ramzan did not spend the &#x000A;night in Makhachkala, and were told, “Ramzan never spends the &#x000A;night anywhere.” &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18. (C) After Ramzan sped off, the dinner and drinking -- &#x000A;especially the latter -- continued. An Avar FSB colonel &#x000A;sitting next to us, dead drunk, was highly insulted that we &#x000A;would not allow him to add “cognac” to our wine. “It’s &#x000A;practically the same thing,” he insisted, until a Russian FSB &#x000A;general sitting opposite told him to drop it. We were &#x000A;inclined to cut the Colonel some slack, though: he is head &#x000A;of the unit to combat terrorism in Dagestan, and Gadzhi told &#x000A;us that extremists have sooner or later assassinated everyone &#x000A;who has joined that unit. We were more worried when an &#x000A;Afghan war buddy of the Colonel’s, Rector of the Dagestan &#x000A;University Law School and too drunk to sit, let alone stand, &#x000A;pulled out his automatic and asked if we needed any &#x000A;protection. At this point Gadzhi and his people came over, &#x000A;propped the rector between their shoulders, and let us get &#x000A;out of range. &#x000A;&#x000A;Postscript: The Practical Uses of a Caucasus Wedding &#x000A;--------------------------------------------- -------- &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19. (C) Kadyrov’s attendance was a mark of respect and &#x000A;alliance, the result of Gadzhi’s careful cultivation -- &#x000A;dating back to personal friendship with Ramzan’s father. &#x000A;This is a necessary political tool in a region where &#x000A;difficulties can only be resolved by using personal &#x000A;relationships to reach ad hoc informal agreements. An &#x000A;example was readily to hand: on August 22 Chechnya’s &#x000A;parliamentary speaker, Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov, gave an &#x000A;interview in which he made specific territorial claims to the &#x000A;Kizlyar, Khasavyurt and Novolak regions of Dagestan. The &#x000A;first two have significant Chechen-Akkin populations, and the &#x000A;last was part of Chechnya until the 1944 deportation, when &#x000A;Stalin forcibly resettled ethnic Laks (a Dagestani &#x000A;nationality) there. Gadzhi said he would have to answer &#x000A;Abdurakhmanov and work closely with Ramzan to reduce the &#x000A;tensions “that fool” had caused. Asked why he took such &#x000A;statements seriously, he told us that in the Caucasus all &#x000A;disputes revolve around land, and such claims can never be &#x000A;&#x000A;MOSCOW 00009533 005 OF 005 &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;dismissed. Unresolved land claims are the “threads” the &#x000A;Russian center always kept in play to pull when needed. We &#x000A;asked why these claims are coming out now, and were told it &#x000A;was euphoria, pure and simple. After all they had received, &#x000A;the Chechen leadership’s feet are miles off the ground. (A &#x000A;well-connected Chechen contact later told us he thought that &#x000A;raising nationalistic irredentism was part of Abdurakhmanov’s &#x000A;effort to gain a political base independent from Kadyrov.) &#x000A;&#x000A;<a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20. (C) The “horizontal of power” represented by Gadzhi’s &#x000A;relationship with Ramzan is the antithesis of the &#x000A;Moscow-imposed “vertical of power.” Gadzhi’s business &#x000A;partner Khalik Gindiyev, head of Rosneft-Kaspoil, complained &#x000A;that Moscow should let local Caucasians rather than Russians &#x000A;-- “Magomadovs and Aliyevs, not Ivanovs and Petrovs” -- &#x000A;resolve the region’s conflicts. The vertical of power, he &#x000A;said, is inapplicable to the Caucasus, a region that Moscow &#x000A;bureaucrats such as PolPred Kozak would never understand. &#x000A;The Caucasus needs to be given the scope to resolve its own &#x000A;problems. But this was not a plug for democracy. Gadzhi &#x000A;told us democracy would always fail in the Caucasus, where &#x000A;the conception of the state is as an extension of the &#x000A;Caucasus family, in which the father’s word is law. “Where &#x000A;is the room for democracy in that?” he asked. We paraphrased &#x000A;Hayek: if you run a family as you do a state, you destroy &#x000A;the family. Running a state as you do a family destroys the &#x000A;state: ties of kinship and friendship will always trump the &#x000A;rule of law. Gadzhi’s partner agreed, shaking his head &#x000A;sadly. “That’s a matter for generations to come,” he said. &#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;BURNS</pre></code>
